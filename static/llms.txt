This guide will walk you through the initial steps of using **WordLift AI SEO Agent**, your AI-powered SEO companion.

## 1. Getting Started:

- **Sign Up:** Head over to the WordLift website and [create a free account](https://wordlift.io/pricing/). A payment method is required to activate the 14-day free trial.

- **Connect Your Website:** Follow the on-screen instructions in the dashboard to connect the WordLift key to your website. This will allow the agent to analyze your website's content and structure.

- **Build Your Knowledge Graph:** Consider building a Knowledge Graph for more comprehensive insights. This can be done manually or by leveraging WordLift's automated tools like the [Product Knowledge Graph builder](https://docs.wordlift.io/product-knowledge-graph-builder/introduction/), the [WordPress plugin](https://docs.wordlift.io/wordpress-plugin/), or the [WordLift Cloud](https://docs.wordlift.io/cloud/). A Knowledge Graph connects relevant entities and concepts related to your website's content, providing valuable context for the AI.

## 2. Exploring the Agent's Functionalities:

- **Set up your key:** To start using the AI SEO Agent, go to [agent.wordlift.io](http://agent.wordlift.io) and enter your WordLift key in the “Settings panel”.

![image](images/agent-wordlift-set-up-your-key.gif)

- **Explore Queries:** Uncover the hidden potential of search queries. Understand how users search for topics related to your content and discover keywords you may want to target. Start simple and ask to the SEO Agent to:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Analyze the query "semantic SEO" on google.com
```

or

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Show me the entity gap between "linked data" and https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/linked-data/
```

- **Create Content:** Leverage your website content for new article creation: As mentioned, ask the Agent to:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Search the website for "the impact of blockchain technology on finance."
Analyze the entities associated with this query.
Generate an outline for a new, informative article based on the combined insights.
```

 This will allow the Agent to analyze your website's content related to blockchain and finance, analyze the entities behind the top-ranking results on Google, and use all of this information to generate a new, informative article.

- **Expand Existing Content:** Enhance your existing content by automatically identifying and suggesting relevant entities that can be integrated seamlessly. This can improve the depth and context of your content, making it more engaging for readers and search engines. It is as simple as asking to:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Expand the content on https://wordlift.io/ by integrating entities like Google and Semantic Web.
```

# Our Commitment to Your Data

At WordLift, we take data privacy and security very seriously. We are committed to **safeguarding any data entrusted to us** and have implemented **robust security measures** to ensure its protection.

## Our Security Measures

- **Secure access controls:** Each user has a dedicated, temporary workspace that stores files only during active use. These workspaces are automatically deleted after inactivity, minimizing data retention.
- **Encryption at rest:** All data sources connected to WordLift are encrypted using the industry-standard AES-256 algorithm, including any PII (personally identifiable information) that may be detected, such as names, addresses, or social security numbers. This ensures confidentiality even if storage systems are compromised.

## Our Service Provider's Data Security

We partner with Microsoft, which adheres to the following data privacy principles for the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service):

- **No data usage for model training:** Azure OpenAI does not use any data you submit (prompts, completions, embeddings, or training data) to train or improve its models. This ensures your data is used solely for the intended purpose within WordLift's functionalities.
- **Limited data retention:** Azure OpenAI stores your prompts and completions for up to 30 days solely for abuse monitoring and human review. This data is deleted unless legal requirements dictate otherwise. Customers can also apply to disable abuse monitoring, in which case their data is not stored. WordLift doesn’t have access to your prompts and completions at all unless we mutually agree to do so to improve the service.
- **Industry-standard security practices:** Azure OpenAI employs rigorous security measures, including:
  - **Double encryption at rest:** Your data is encrypted by default with Microsoft's AES-256 and can be optionally encrypted with your key.
  - **Limited human access:** Only authorized Microsoft personnel can access flagged data for abuse monitoring using secure methods with strict access controls.

## Transparency and Access to Information

We believe in transparency and empower you to access information about your data and how it is handled.

- **Azure OpenAI Service data privacy:** For further details on Azure OpenAI's security measures and data usage policies, please refer to their documentation: [Azure OpenAI Data Privacy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy)

:::

With Instagram switching from "part-indexed" to "fully indexable" in Google Search on July 10, 2025, every reel, carousel, and highlight can become a valuable search asset. This workflow helps you analyze how well your Instagram content aligns with your website content and organic search rankings.

## How Agent WordLift Works in This Analysis

Agent WordLift automatically uses multiple sophisticated tools to provide comprehensive Instagram indexing analysis that goes far beyond basic social media analytics:

- **Google Search Console Integration** – Pulls real performance data from your website with 2025 search trends
- **Live SERP Analysis** – Conducts real-time visibility checks showing exact rankings (e.g., "#3 for brand terms")
- **Google Trends Analysis** – Identifies search spikes and correlates them with content performance (e.g., "100/100 trend spike in May 2025")
- **Entity Gap Analysis** – Compares content themes between Instagram and website with precision scoring
- **Advanced Search Operators** – Automatically runs complex queries to audit Instagram exposure across multiple dimensions
- **Competitive Intelligence** – Benchmarks your visibility against medical authorities and industry competitors
- **Emerging Keyword Discovery** – Identifies new trending terms like "chad aesthetic" and "chirurgia estetica mandibola"
- **Cross-Platform Correlation** – Shows how content performance connects across Instagram, website, and search behavior

### What Makes This Analysis Unique

Unlike traditional social media analytics, this workflow provides **verified search performance data** showing exactly how Instagram content performs in Google's organic search results, with insights like:

- Instagram ranking #3 for "ortognatica roma" (above Facebook and YouTube)
- Instagram ranking #5 for competitive medical terms like "chirurgia ortognatica roma"
- Correlation between May 2025 search spikes and Instagram content effectiveness
- 92% content alignment scores between website strategy and indexed social content

## Why This Matters

With **AI Overviews reducing organic CTR by 34–37%**, social media indexing becomes critical for visibility. Instagram accounts are already ranking above medical directories for competitive terms even before the July 10th switch.

## Prerequisites

1. **Set up MCP Integration**: Follow our [MCP setup guide](../integrations.md#agent-wordlift-model-context-protocol-mcp-integration) to connect Agent WordLift with your preferred AI assistant
2. **Google Search Console Access**: Ensure your website is connected to Google Search Console
3. **Instagram Account**: Access to the Instagram account you want to analyze

## Step-by-Step Workflow

```

### Step 2: Website Content Analysis

Ask Agent WordLift to analyze your website's current content:

```
Using Agent WordLift, analyze my website's content for the following topics: [list your main topics]. I want to understand what content themes are already covered on my site.
```

### Step 3: Content Alignment Analysis

Compare your Instagram content with your website content:

```
Compare the topics and keywords from my Instagram posts with my website content. Identify:
- Content gaps where Instagram covers topics not on my website
- Opportunities to create website content based on successful Instagram posts
- Keyword overlaps and potential cannibalization issues
```

### Step 4: SERP Position Analysis

Check where your Instagram content ranks for your target keywords:

```
For my main keywords [list keywords], check:
- Where my Instagram posts rank in search results
- Where my website pages rank for the same keywords
- Which content type (Instagram vs website) performs better for each keyword
```

### Step 5: Competitive Intelligence

Analyze competitors' Instagram indexing:

```
Analyze my top 3 competitors' Instagram indexing:
- @{competitor1}
- @{competitor2}
- @{competitor3}

Compare their indexed content volume and topics with mine.
```

### Step 6: Content Strategy Recommendations

Get actionable recommendations:

```
Based on the analysis, provide recommendations for:
- Which Instagram posts should be expanded into website content
- Which website topics should be covered more on Instagram
- Optimization strategies for better search visibility
- Content calendar suggestions for July-December 2025
```

## Example Prompts for AI Assistants

# Search Intent Match

This workflow is designed to help us **align our content with the intended search query** to ensure maximum relevance and engagement from our target audience. By understanding and [matching the search intent](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/search-intent-optimization/), we can create content that not only ranks well but also satisfies the user's informational needs.

## Here are the steps

To ensure your webpage aligns perfectly with the intended search query, follow this streamlined workflow:

## 1. Identify the Core Query and Intent

Start by pinpointing the exact query you aim to target. Understand the intent behind the search - is it informational, navigational, transactional, or investigational? You can try a prompt like the one below:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
evaluate the content quality for the keyword 'Future-Proof Your Content From Google Core Updates' in relation to the content on 'https://wordlift.io/blog/en/google-core-update-ai-interview/' the intent is to gain information on how to improve existing content.
```

With this prompt, we define the **query**, the **url** as well as the narrative behind the searcher's intent.

### Here is what we get

![image](../images/agent-wordlift-query-match.png)

## 2. Expand the content based on the analysis

Within the first response, we can now proceed with the following step to gain new insights on how to improve the article in order to match the provided query and search intent:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Can you help me improve and expand the blog post to match the query?
```

### Here are the suggestions

![image](../images/agent-wordlift-query-match-expansion.png)

# Enhancing Internal Linking with WordLift AI SEO Agent

[Internal linking](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/dynamic-internal-links-in-seo/) is a critical aspect of SEO, helping to establish site architecture and spread link equity. With WordLift [AI SEO Agent](https://wordlift.io/ai-seo-agent/), you can streamline the process of creating internal links to enhance your website's SEO and user experience. This guide will walk you through the steps to effectively use Agent WordLift for creating internal links on your website.

## Overview of Internal Linking

Internal links are hyperlinks that point to other pages on the same website. They are crucial for helping search engines understand the structure and content hierarchy of your site, as well as for guiding visitors to related content. Effective internal linking can improve your site's SEO by ensuring that link equity is passed to the most important pages.

## Steps to Create Internal Links with Agent WordLift

### Step 1: Identify Content for Internal Linking

First, identify the pages on your website that you want to enrich by adding internal links. These could be cornerstone content, high-traffic pages, or pages you want to improve with links pointing to other relevant pages.

### Example Prompt for Identifying Related Articles

In the example below we use as a reference the WordLift blog.

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Find content on my website from the “What is structured data?” page (https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/structured-data/). Analyze the text to identify up to 5 related articles. For each article, determine a relevant keyword, generate keyword suggestions for each keyword, and create an anchor text of no more than 30 characters. Finally, compile the HTML for all 5 links with their respective anchor texts.
```

![image](../images/agent-wordlift-internal-links_01.png)

### Step 2: Batch Processing for Multiple Pages

If you need to create internal links for multiple pages, you can use a more comprehensive prompt to handle this in batches.

### Example Prompt for Batch Processing

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Find content on my website from the “What is structured data?” page (https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/structured-data/). Analyze the text to identify up to 5 related articles. For each article, determine a relevant keyword, generate keyword suggestions for each keyword, and create an anchor text of no more than 30 characters. Finally, compile the HTML for all 5 links with their respective anchor texts. Do the same work also for the pages: "The GS1 Digital Link explained for SEO Jedis (and their clients)" (https://wordlift.io/blog/en/gs1-digital-link-seo/), "Dynamic Internal Links in SEO: Your Superhero in the Generative AI Era" (https://wordlift.io/blog/en/dynamic-internal-links-in-seo/), "Understanding LLM Optimization: Ethical AI and Protecting Your Content" (https://wordlift.io/blog/en/understanding-llm-optimization/) and "From Harold Cohen to Modern AI: The Power of Symbolic Reasoning" (https://wordlift.io/blog/en/the-power-of-symbolic-reasoning/). Remember the following rules: never link to the homepage of the blog (https://wordlift.io/blog/en/) choose carefully the anchor based on the content relevancy and keyword opportunity analysis.
```

### Step 3: Execute the Prompt with WordLift AI SEO Agent

Using the prompts provided, execute the commands with WordLift AI SEO Agent. The tool will analyze the specified pages, identify related articles, and generate appropriate internal links along with suggested anchor texts.

### Step 4: Review and Implement the Suggestions

Once the internal links and anchor texts are generated, review them to ensure they align with your content strategy and SEO goals. Make any necessary adjustments before implementing them on your website.

## Best Practices for Internal Linking

1. **Use Descriptive Anchor Texts:** Ensure that the anchor texts are descriptive and relevant to the linked content.
2. **Link to Relevant Content:** Only link to pages that are contextually relevant to the content on the source page.
3. **Avoid Over-Linking:** Do not overcrowd your content with too many internal links, as this can dilute their value and affect readability.
4. **Regularly Update Links:** Periodically review and update your internal links to ensure they are still relevant and effective.

By following these steps and utilizing WordLift AI SEO Agent, you can create a robust internal linking structure that enhances your website's SEO performance and provides a better user experience.

# Evaluating Content Quality with WordLift AI SEO Agent

The Content Quality Evaluation workflow allows you to comprehensively assess your content across multiple dimensions including quality, readability, and SEO performance. This powerful tool provides actionable insights to improve your content and make it more engaging for both users and search engines.

## Overview of Content Evaluation

WordLift's Content Evaluation Tool goes beyond traditional SEO analysis by examining multiple dimensions of your content:

- **Content Quality**: Analyzes purpose, accuracy, and depth of your content
- **Readability**: Evaluates reading level, sentence complexity, and overall clarity
- **SEO Performance**: Assesses keyword usage, density, and optimization
- **Metadata**: Examines word count, sentiment, and other technical aspects

The tool visualizes these metrics through an intuitive radar chart, making it easy to identify strengths and areas for improvement.

## How to Use the Content Quality Evaluator

### Step 1: Analyze Your Content

Start by analyzing your content against a specific keyword or topic to understand how well it addresses the intended search intent. You can evaluate content in two ways:

**Option 1: Evaluate content at a URL:**

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
evaluate the content quality for the keyword "content marketing strategies" in relation to the content on "https://your-website.com/your-page"
```

**Option 2: Evaluate text directly:**

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
evaluate the following text for the keyword "content marketing strategies":

[Paste your content here]
```

You can include multiple keywords for a more comprehensive evaluation:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
evaluate the content quality for the keywords "content marketing strategies, SEO optimization, content distribution" in relation to the content on "https://your-website.com/your-page"
```

The tool works effectively with or without specified keywords. If no keywords are provided, it will identify the main topics of your content automatically.

### Evaluating Specific Content Sections

You can evaluate either entire articles or specific sections of your content:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
evaluate only the introduction section of the content on "https://your-website.com/your-page" for the keyword "content marketing"
```

This allows you to focus on improving specific parts of your content that may need more attention.

### Analyzing Multiple Content Pieces

When evaluating multiple pieces of content, you can request the agent to omit the chart visualization for a more streamlined analysis:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
evaluate the following URLs without rendering charts:
1. https://your-website.com/page-1
2. https://your-website.com/page-2
3. https://your-website.com/page-3

Compare their content quality and provide a summary table of the results.
```

This is particularly useful for batch analysis and content comparison tasks where visual charts for each piece might be overwhelming.

### Step 2: Review the Evaluation Results

The agent will return detailed analysis results including:

- An overall quality score (0-100)
- Breakdown of scores across multiple dimensions
- Specific insights about content strengths and weaknesses
- Visualization of the results in a radar chart

![Content Quality Evaluation](../images/agent-wordlift-content-evaluation.png)

### Step 3: Implement Content Improvements

Based on the evaluation, you can then request specific improvements:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
based on the content quality evaluation, please suggest improvements to enhance the content purpose, depth, and readability
```

The agent will provide tailored recommendations to address the specific areas where your content needs improvement.

## Understanding the Evaluation Metrics

### Content Quality Metrics

- **Purpose**: How well the content fulfills its intended goal and satisfies user intent
- **Accuracy**: Factual correctness and trustworthiness of the information
- **Depth**: Comprehensiveness and thoroughness of topic coverage

### Readability Metrics

- **Score**: Overall readability level of the content
- **Grade Level**: Educational level required to easily understand the content
- **Complex Sentences**: Analysis of sentence complexity and suggestions for improvement

### SEO Metrics

- **Score**: Overall search optimization assessment
- **Keyword Density**: Analysis of keyword usage and distribution
- **Top Entities**: Important concepts and topics identified in the content

## Best Practices for Content Evaluation

1. **Evaluate Regularly**: Periodically assess your most important pages to ensure they remain optimized
2. **Compare with Competitors**: Evaluate your content against top-ranking competitors for the same keywords
3. **Focus on Weakest Areas First**: Prioritize improvements for dimensions with the lowest scores
4. **Balance All Dimensions**: Aim for consistent performance across all metrics rather than excellence in just one area
5. **Test Improvements**: After making changes, re-evaluate to confirm the enhancements were effective

By following this workflow, you can systematically improve your content across multiple dimensions, resulting in better engagement, higher authority, and improved search visibility.

:::tip
For content that targets multiple keywords or topics, consider running separate evaluations for each major keyword to ensure comprehensive optimization.

### Here goes the prompt

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Search for 'neuro-symbolic AI' and carefully analyze the writing style on my website, then extract entities and suggest keywords, and, with this in mind, write three SEO-optimized LinkedIn posts to promote the topic to a business audience in the publishing sector. Always add links back to the website to help users discover additional information.
```

### Here goes the prompt for X

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Search for 'neuro-symbolic AI' and carefully analyze the writing style on my website and, with this in mind, create a Twitter thread to promote the topic to web publishers. Always add links back to the website to help users discover additional information.

# Creating frequently asked questions (FAQs)

This workflow is designed to help us with the process of creating **frequently asked questions (FAQs)** based on content from our website and insights from WordLift's AI SEO Agent.

# Understanding the Entity Gap

The first step involves analyzing the "*entity gap*" between a specific webpage and a user query. Entities are essentially keywords or concepts that define a topic.

:::info

WordLift's AI SEO Agent helps us understand the entity gap by:

* **Identifying key entities on a webpage:** This helps us understand what information the page covers.
* **Analyzing top search results:** The Agent looks at the entities mentioned in top-ranking pages for the same query.
* **Highligting missing entities:** By comparing these, the Agent identifies concepts relevant to the topic but missing from our webpage.

This analysis helps us create FAQs that address potential user questions based on what our content might be missing.

:::

## Generate Questions Based on the Entity Gap Analysis

For example, imagine this workflow is analyzing the entity gap between the blog post "Neuro-symbolic AI: Where Knowledge Graphs Meet LLMs" on the WordLift blog and the search query "*neuro-symbolic AI*".

**Entity Gap Analysis**: The AI SEO Agent would analyze the blog post and identify key entities related to "neuro-symbolic AI" that are not explicitly mentioned.

**Top Missing Entities**: Based on this analysis, the Agent would determine the top three missing entities most relevant to understanding "neuro-symbolic AI" in the context of the blog post.

**Question Generation**: Finally, the workflow would use these missing entities to automatically generate three relevant questions users might have about "neuro-symbolic AI."

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Analyze the entity gap between https://wordlift.io/blog/en/neuro-symbolic-ai/ and the query "neuro-symbolic AI", look at the top missing entities and, if they are relevant, generate three questions accordingly.
```

![image](../images/agent-wordlift-top-missing-entities.png)

## Answer the Questions

Once the questions are generated, we can provide the agent with a new prompt that will automatically search the website and relevant sources to find answers. It will also consider the writing style of the target webpage to ensure the answers are consistent and informative.

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Now, search on the website, read the writing style and prepare the answer for the first question "How does Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) relate to the development of neuro-symbolic AI systems, and what are the potential implications of integrating AGI capabilities into neuro-symbolic models?". Remember to add links back to the sources.
```

This approach allows for efficient generation of FAQs that address potential user queries based on the content of a webpage.

# Avoiding Keyword Cannibalization with WordLift AI SEO Agent

In this workflow, we'll explore how to identify and resolve **keyword cannibalization** issues using the WordLift AI SEO Agent. Keyword cannibalization occurs when multiple pages on your website target the same keyword, causing them to compete against each other in search engine rankings. This can dilute your SEO efforts and confuse search engines about which page to rank for the keyword.

## Identifying Keyword Overlap Between Pages

Let's utilize the content analysis tools to extract entities, keywords, and understand the detailed search intent behind each page. This will help us identify overlapping areas and develop strategies to differentiate the content.

### Example Prompt for Analyzing and Differentiating Pages

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Search the following pages from the website using the search tool:

- **URL1:** Article: https://wordlift.io/blog/en/underutilized-schema-markups-for-publishers/
  - **Title1:** Underutilized Schema Markups for Publishers

- **URL2:** Article: https://wordlift.io/blog/en/structured-data-for-personal-branding/
  - **Title2:** Structured Data for Personal Branding

For each page, perform the following analyses:

- **Extract Entities:**
  - Use the content analysis tool to extract entities mentioned in each page.

- **Identify Keywords:**
  - Determine the primary and secondary keywords based on the content and metadata.

- **Determine Detailed Search Intent:**
  - Present a detailed description of the search (user) intent, going beyond simple categories.

**Present the analysis results in a table**, including:

- URL
- Title
- Primary Keywords
- Secondary Keywords
- Extracted Entities
- Detailed Search Intent

**Propose strategies to differentiate the pages:**

- Suggest ways to distinguish each page's content, focusing on unique aspects of content, keywords, and entities.
- Recommend optimizations to improve SEO performance, prevent keyword cannibalization, and enhance user experience.
```

Using this prompt, the WordLift AI SEO Agent will analyze each page and provide insights into potential overlaps and differentiation opportunities.

## Understanding the Analysis

The agent's analysis will help you:

- **Identify Keyword Overlaps:** See if both pages are targeting the same primary or secondary keywords.
- **Extracted Entities Comparison:** Determine if the pages mention the same entities, indicating content overlap.
- **Detailed Search Intent:** Understand the specific goals and needs of users for each page, going beyond generic intent categories.

## Developing Strategies to Differentiate Content

Based on the analysis, you can implement the right strategy to prevent keyword cannibalization and consolidate or differentiate content.

By following this workflow, you can effectively identify and resolve keyword cannibalization issues. Differentiating your content not only improves SEO performance but also enhances user experience by providing clear, distinct information on each page.

This approach helps us explore the search landscape more comprehensively, identifying opportunities and understanding user intent.

## Sophisticated Prompt for Blog Post Outline

We can also venture into a more sophisticated prompt that will automatically run the analysis and draft the outline of a blog post:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Propose three keyword ideas for "aromatherapy". For each keyword, provide suggestions, extract the topics, and present all the data in a table highlighting the opportunities. Then provide me with the outline for a blog post on the keyword that has the highest chance, keeping in mind the seasonality of the main keyword.

## Quick Start

Begin with this simple prompt to create authorship markup:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Create authorship markup for [Author Name]. Include their professional background, current role, and significant achievements.
```

## How it Works

Agent WordLift follows a comprehensive process to create authoritative authorship markup:

1. **Information Gathering**
   - Scans trusted sources (Bing, Google, LinkedIn, Google Books)
   - Verifies professional information
   - Identifies key achievements and credentials

2. **Markup Generation**
   - Creates JSON-LD structured data
   - Includes verified professional details
   - Links to authoritative profiles

3. **Knowledge Graph Integration**
   - Stores data as RDF triples
   - Maintains data consistency
   - Enables future updates

## Advanced Usage

### Creating Author Biographies

After storing the authorship markup, generate a compelling biography:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Generate a concise, professional biography using the stored information for [Author Name].
```

### Updating Existing Markup

Keep author information current with this prompt:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Update the authorship markup for [Author Name] with their latest achievements and roles.
```

## Best Practices

- **Verification**: Always verify author information from multiple authoritative sources
- **Completeness**: Include all relevant professional credentials and achievements
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent author information across your website
- **Updates**: Regularly review and update author information to reflect current roles and achievements

## The Impact on SEO

Proper authorship markup contributes to your content's E-E-A-T signals by:

- Establishing author expertise and credibility
- Creating verifiable connections to professional profiles
- Supporting content trustworthiness
- Enhancing structured data for better search visibility

:::tip

For scaled content operations, consider using the [Content Generation Tool](/content-generation/) in conjunction with authorship markup to maintain consistent author attribution across your website.

## Overview

This API allows you to submit text content and receive an evaluation based on predefined metrics or models. It provides scores for content quality, readability, and SEO aspects.

## Basic Usage

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.wordlift.io/content-evaluations \
  --header 'Authorization: Key YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "text": "Your text content goes here...",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
}'
```

The API evaluates your content and returns detailed quality metrics including:
- Overall quality score
- Content assessment (purpose, accuracy, depth)
- Readability metrics
- SEO analysis with keyword density and entity recognition

# WordLift Image-to-Text API

API for converting images into text descriptions. This service allows you to extract textual descriptions from images using AI.

<div style={{"marginBottom":"2rem"}}><h2 id={"authentication"} style={{"marginBottom":"1rem"}}>Authentication</h2><SchemaTabs className={"openapi-tabs__security-schemes"}><TabItem label={"API Key: ApiKeyAuth"} value={"ApiKeyAuth"}><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Security Scheme Type:</th><td>apiKey</td></tr><tr><th>Header parameter name:</th><td>Authorization</td></tr></tbody></table></div></TabItem></SchemaTabs></div>

## Basic Usage

The Image-to-Text API allows you to convert images into descriptive text. Here's a basic example:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.wordlift.io/image-2-text-v1 \
  --header 'Authorization: Key YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "image_url": "https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg",
    "prompt_type": "Other",
    "custom_prompt": "Generate concise and descriptive text for the image"
}'

# Content Generation Tool
Welcome to the world of content creation at scale, where challenges abound in harnessing the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful language models possess vast knowledge but also suffer from a critical flaw: **they don't know what they know**. However, a solution lies within the data-rich landscape of knowledge graphs. **By leveraging the data within these graphs built using WordLift, we can steer the model's knowledge, curtail hallucinations, and establish a robust validation pipeline**.

At the heart of this transformative content creation process lies an essential tool: **the ontology**. 

By harnessing the power of ontology (or of linked data vocabularies such as schema.org), **we gain the ability to fine-tune and prompt LLMs, significantly enhancing the accuracy of their predictions**.

This dynamic journey begins with a simple content idea, evolving into a sophisticated process of crafting tailored prompts that works best with your data. Drawing from an extensive pool of data available inside the knowledge graphs, **these prompts possess the remarkable potential to generate an infinite array of content variations**, precisely catering to any specific need or context.

![image](../images/content-generation-prompt-template-workflow.png)
*The workflow for creating a prompt template using the attributes in your Knowledge Graph*. 

Furthermore, the implementation of a well-structured **validation pipeline plays a crucial role in the content creation process**. This pipeline serves as a rigorous quality assurance mechanism, allowing us to meticulously examine and fine-tune the output generated by the Large Language Model (LLM). 

As we navigate the landscape of content generation, **the harmonious convergence of knowledge graphs, ontologies (structured data), and LLMs promises to transform how we create content**. It paves the way for more efficient, accurate, and scalable content generation, revolutionizing the possibilities for creative expression and knowledge dissemination in today's dynamic digital world.


# What is the Content Generation Tool? 
WordLift's **Content Generation Tool is a dynamic solution**, engineered to streamline the production of succinct, engaging, and detailed text for a multitude of purposes. Whether you're crafting product descriptions, restaurant profiles, or introductory text for category pages, our tool delivers results you can trust. Developed in close collaboration with editorial teams and SEO professionals from midsize to large organizations, our Content Generation Tool guarantees the generation of high-quality content tailored to meet your **enterprise's specific needs**.

The tool uses a **dynamic [prompt](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/prompt/) generated using the data from your knowledge graph and a fine-tuned model customized** to align with your brand's specific examples. This customization ensures the generated content maintains **a consistent tone and style per your brand's identity**.

The content produced by the tool can be verified for accuracy through **validation rules that you define using the data in your knowledge graph**. This enables you to ensure that the generated content adheres to your company's editorial guidelines and standards, providing content that meets your specific requirements.

![image](../images/content-generation-validation-pipeline-process.png)
*Here is how the validation pipeline works*.


# Get Started 
To get started, log into your dashboard and you'll find '*Content Generation*' on the left. If you click on it, you can use the feature that allows you to **create large-scale content for your website**.

![image](../images/content-generation-dashboard-intro.png)


# How it works
Once you click '*Content Generation*' and create the '*New project*', you will arrive at the step-by-step wizard. 

![image](../images/content-generation-dashboard_new.png)


## Step 1 - Selecting Data Source
In this step, you give the project a name and **select the knowledge graph** you want to use. At this point, you will have to extract the data, and thus the attributes, that you will need to create the prompt that you will use later. 

![image](../images/content-generation-get-started.png)

**To extract the data, you will use a GraphQL query**. In the section *Preset*, you can select a template query, using the attributes of schema.org, or you can choose any custom ontology your knowledge graph might use.

![image](../images/content-generation-data-source.png)

Here below is an example query that will extract the following attributes from a Product Knowledge Graph:
- **id**: the unique ID of the product inside the knowledge graph;
- **url**: the url of the associated web page (product description page);
- **material**: the material of the product (here we use strings when constructing the query; as we might have multiple associated materials);
- **names**: the names of the product, also in this case we might have multiple names;
- **description**: the existing description of the product;
- **brand**: the name of the brand (here we can use that the data related to the brand is an additional node in the graph, we use the curly brackets to extract data from a sub-node, in this example we only get the name of the brand);
- **price**: the price of the product.  

We can also see that in **the query below** we’re only getting the top 10 products as we’re limiting the results by passing the page (0) and the number of rows (10) at the beginning of the query. 

```
query {
  products(page:0, rows:10) {
    id: iri
	url: strings(name: "schema:url")
	material: strings(name: "schema:material")
	names: strings(name:"schema:name")
    brand: resource(name:"schema:brand"){
    	brand: string(name: "schema:name")
  	}
	price: resource(name:"schema:offers"){
    	price: string(name: "schema:price")}
	}
}
```


## Step 2 - Configuring the prompt
You can **create a dynamic and flexible prompt** using the data you extracted from your knowledge graph. To create your prompt template, you can **use the attributes** that interest you from those you previously selected. We use, as a templating language: [**Liquid**](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), an open-source language invented by Shopify. Thanks to the template we can for example prevent a section of the prompt from appearing when some attributes are missing in the knowledge graph. Here is an example.

```
As the content writer of a luxury fashion brand write a short but catchy product description for the {{names}} {% if description %} by revising the following paragraph: 
{{description}}{% endif %}.###
```

Here we make sure that if the description is present we take it into consideration in the prompt (see everything inside the {% if description %}{% endif %} block. 

![image](../images/content-generation-prompt-configuration.png)

Once you have added the attributes, **you can see the template** you have built for your prompt (sample prompt), which allows you to assess whether **the prompt meets your needs** or if you need to improve it in anything. Then **you can select the language model** you want to use. Before going to the next step, you can **set up the configuration parameters** (length, penalty, creativity) of the generation and **see a sample completion**. If you are not satisfied with the outcome, you can make changes, or if that is OK, you can go to the next step. 

The user interface enables you to validate both the prompt and generation settings across multiple data samples. As data can vary, a prompt effective for one product may not necessarily be effective for another. 

We encourage you to **collaborate with our team of specialists to discover the optimal configuration for your specific use-case**. The project you're configuring is designed to be scalable, with potential for reuse across thousands of entities. Also remember, when speaking with our team, that configuration parameters are highly dependent on the model being used for the task. 

![image](../images/content-generation-prompt-configuration-completed.png)


## Step 3 - Defining Validation Rules 
We've developed **a flexible validation process** enabling you to establish **customized validation rules** aligning with your specific needs. This ensures the generated content not only meets your expectations but also adheres to your **brand's or company's editorial guidelines**. Furthermore, you gain the ability to dictate when and **how AI should fix the generated content** to maintain compliance with your established rules.

Firstly, decide whether your rule should **be based on a specific data field or a set of words**. We distinguish between validation checks associated with attributes (termed '*Field Based*') and those related to specific words (termed '*Word Based*').

![image](../images/content-generation-validation-rules-field-or-word-based.png)

**Let's examine a sample rule**. In this scenario (an e-commerce website), we're scrutinizing the predicted completion (i.e., the generated text) to check for any mention of color, ensuring that it aligns with the color attributes detailed in the knowledge graph. We've also stipulated this rule as a requirement, implying that no content will be considered valid unless it includes an accurate reference to the product's color.

![image](../images/content-generation-validation-rules.png)

Here are the proposed settings for each and every rule:
1. **Rule Name**: Assign a distinctive name to the rule for easy recognition.
2. **Level**: Choose if the rule is '*required*' or '*recommended*.' If the '*required*' rule is not met, the completion status will show as ERROR. If a '*recommended*' rule isn't fulfilled, it will result in a WARNING status.
3. **What**: Define the specific components or conditions of the rule.
4. **When**: Specify when the rule is active - whether it's always in effect, or only under certain circumstances.

And then “*Save*”.

Let’s add now one more rule, this time “Word Based” to ensure that not ethnic group is mentioned in the generated text.  

![image](../images/content-generation-validation-rules-completed.png)

In this example we check whether any mentioned term is present in the completion (as you can see multiple terms are separated by comma); the rule will check that the requirement is fulfilled.

If it is not satisfied, it will try to fix the problem using an additional prompt that we have added (Ai Based). See the prompt below:

```
As {{brand}} content editor, read the following sentence and rewrite it by removing any reference to the {{value}}: "{{completion}}"
```

With this rule the system will retry (three or five times depending if it is recommended or required) to **solve the problem**.
Once we have completed all the steps, you can **save the project and start the generation**.

![image](../images/content-generation-results.png)

Completions generated are processed and divided into: 
1. **Valid**: This status indicates that the completions have successfully passed the validation process in accordance with the rules you have set previously.
2. **Warning**: This status is assigned to generations that have satisfied 'recommended' rules but have failed to meet 'required' ones.
3. **Error**: This status is given when validation errors occur due to the absence of words or attributes that you had specified to be included. These flawed completions can either be automatically regenerated or manually rewritten and then approved.
4. **Accepted**: This status is applied to all the generations that you have reviewed and confirmed as satisfactory.

Bear in mind that the editor always has the ability to review completions that did not pass validation, and move them to the validated column. Additionally, each completion can be effortlessly regenerated as needed by the system.

# API Guide

## Introduction

The Content Generation API is based on Projects. Each Project contains the configuration that allows to:

1. Query and select data from the Knowledge Graph
1. Define a Prompt Template that is filled with the selected data
1. Configure the Model and its parameters

This webpage will provide a step-by-step guide on how to create, configure and run a Content Generation Project.

The API is organized according to the REST principles and in particular the [Zalando's Best Practices](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/).

:::tip

[The Content Generation API Reference is available here](https://docs.wordlift.io/api/content-generation/content-generation/).

The [openapi.yaml is available here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wordlift/docs/main/api/content-generation.yaml), it can be used to automatically generate clients.

:::

## Authorization

:::info

Using the Content Generation API requires an OAuth2 Access Token.

:::

### Get an Access Token

An Access Token can be requested using User Credentials (username and password). This is a very simple method which only requires using the API Client ID (`W8sGqXvefG9XgnMXJYzk6nTiV6MWc3N8TyQJQJcO`). This method is useful when building client apps that don't have a direct interaction with the user.

This is an example CURL:

```sh
curl -X "POST" "https://s.wordlift.io/oauth/token/" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8' \
     --data-urlencode "grant_type=password" \
     --data-urlencode "username=<your-user-name-or-email-address>" \
     --data-urlencode "password=<your-password>" \
     --data-urlencode "client_id=W8sGqXvefG9XgnMXJYzk6nTiV6MWc3N8TyQJQJcO"
```

The server will reply with an Access Token (which expires after one hour) and Refresh Token to request a new Access Token:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<access-token>",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "scope": "basic",
  "refresh_token": "<refresh-token>"
}
```

### Refresh Access Token

An expired Access Token can't be used anymore. In this case it is possible to request a new Access Token using the Refresh Token at the previous step.

```sh
curl -X "POST" "https://s.wordlift.io/oauth/token/" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8' \
     --data-urlencode "grant_type=refresh_token" \
     --data-urlencode "refresh_token=<refresh-token>" \
     --data-urlencode "client_id=W8sGqXvefG9XgnMXJYzk6nTiV6MWc3N8TyQJQJcO"
```

The server will reply with an Access Token (which expires after one hour) and refresh token to request a new Access Token:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<access-token>",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "scope": "basic",
  "refresh_token": "<refresh-token>"
}
```

:::caution

Please note that also the Refresh Token is updated.

:::

## Create a Project

A the very core of the Content Generation API, there are Projects which define the configuration.

```

#### Knowledge Graph Account ID {#account-id}

The Account ID is used to connect to a Knowledge Graph. To retrive the list of Accounts use the List Accounts API:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/accounts?limit=2147483647&can_content_generation=true' \
    -H 'Accept: application/vnd.wordlift.accounts+json;version=1' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>'
```

:::note

The `content_generation` query parameter must be set to `true` in order to retrieve only Accounts that support Content Generation.

    },
    ...
```

:::info

The `key` contains the WordLift Key that can be used with the [GraphQL API](#graphql-api).

:::


#### GraphQL Query {#graphql-api}

The GraphQL Query runs against the Knowledge Graph to query and select the data. This is an example GraphQL Query to retrieve the default Products' data:

```graphql
query {
   p: products(page:0,rows:10) {
     id: iri
     names: strings(name:"schema:name")
     types: refs(name:"rdf:type")
     urls: refs(name:"schema:url")
     material: strings(name:"schema:material")
     category: strings(name:"schema:category")
     color: strings(name:"schema:color")
     audience: resources(name:"schema:audience") {
       audienceType: strings(name:"schema:audienceType")
    }
     offers: resources(name:"schema:offers") {
       price: strings(name:"schema:price")
    }
   }
 }
 ```

It is possible to retrieve other GraphQL sample queryies by using the [GraphQL Query presets API](#graphql-presets).

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/graphql' -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Key <wordlift-key>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-raw '...graphql-query...'
```

:::tip

Before creating a Project it is advised to test the GraphQL query using the GraphQL Query endpoint.

:::

:::caution

The GraphQL query requires to use the WordLift Key associated with a Knowledge Graph (Account). The key can be found in the [Dashboard](https://my.wordlift.io) or by calling the [Accounts API](#account-id).

:::

#### Model

The `model_id` property requires a model ID. To retrieve the available models and their ID the following API is used:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/models?limit=2147483647' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>'
```

      "type": "openai"
    },
    ...
```

:::info

Almost all of the list API use cursor-based navigation.

:::

#### Prompt Template

The Prompt Template is used to dynamically create the Prompts by replacing placeholders with actual values from the selected records. Templates use the [Liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) which allows to build an extensive logic into the template.

In order to retrieve the list of available fields it is possible to use the [Fields API](#list-fields). A template can be tested with actual data by calling the [Template Render API](#render-template).

A template can be as simple as this:

```liquid
{{names.0}} is a {{types.0}}.
The material is {{material.0}} and it can be found in the {{category.0}}.
Its color is {{color.0}} and its targeted at {{audience.audienceType.0}}.
The price tag is {{offers.price.0}}.

More information can be found at {{urls.0}}.
```

Or as complex as this:

```liquid

## Run the Project

### Load the KG Data into the Project's Records

This will finally load the data from the Knowledge Graph based on the GraphQL query into the Project's records.

:::info

This step is required in order to create the completions.

:::

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/<project-id>/syncs' -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: */*' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>'
```

If successful, the server will return a 200 OK with no content.

### List Completions

Once the Records have been imported, it is possible to access them along with their completion. This endpoint returns a JSONL formatted response which allows client to read the response as it loads without waiting for all the completions to be generated.

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/<project-id>/records-sse' \
    -H 'Accept: */*' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>'
```

This is an example **response**, note that it is a [JSONL (JSON Lines)](https://jsonlines.org/) response, that is one full parsable JSON per line:

Once the Project runs, the completions are generated and they're validated against the [Rules](#rules). For each completion a state is assigned: error, warning, valid and accepted. The Stats endpoint will provide a summary of these states for the Project:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/<project-id>/stats' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>'
```

This is an example **response**:

```json
{ "total": 4, "accepted": 0, "valid": 0, "warnings": 4, "errors": 4 }
```

This is an explation of the properties in the response:

| Property | Description                                                            |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| total    | The total number of records                                            |
| accepted | The number of accepted records                                         |
| valid    | The number of valid records, i.e. records without warnings or errors   |
| warnings | The number of records with warnings (but no errors)                    |
| errors   | The number of records with errors                                      |


### Regenerate a Record Completion {#regenerate-record-completion}

To regenerate a Completion, just update it by setting the `completion` to `null`. The API will then regenerate and return the Record with the new Completion.

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/608/records/253191' -X PUT \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>' \
     --data-raw '...json payload...'
```

Example JSON Payload, note the `completion` set to `null`:

```json

### Get a Record Validation Report

Get a Record validation report with details about the Rules that failed:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/<project-id>/records/<record-id>/validations' -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>'
```

Calling this API will force the platform to revalidate the completion against the configured rules. The response format is the same as the [Regenerate Completion API](#regenerate-record-completion).

### Bulk Operations on Record: Regenerate Completions

It is also possible to regenerate completions in bulk:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/<project-id>/records-collection' -X PUT \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>' \
     --data-raw '[...json payload 1...,...json payload 2...,...,...json payload n....]'
```

### Accept a Record

To mark a Record as Accepted, set `is_accepted` to `true`:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/<project-id>/records/<record-id>' -X PUT \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>' \
     --data-raw '...json payload...'

### Bulk Operations

It is always possible to combine several updates in one call:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/<project-id>/records-collection' -X PUT \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>' \
     --data-raw '[...json payload 1...,...json payload 2...,...,...json payload n...]'
```

### Export

Finally it is possible to export the Records:

```sh
curl https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/<project-id>/records.tsv \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>' \
```

This will export a tabulated file with all the Records.

  "modified_at": "2023-12-20T10:37:32.927042427Z"
}
```

### Create a Word Rule

Create a Word Rule for the Project:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/<project-id>/rules' -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>' \

### List Property Fields {#list-fields}

By providing a GraphQL Query, this API will return the available fields in the response. The list of fields can be used to determine the placeholders to use in the Liquid template:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/fields' -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/graphql' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>' \
     --data-raw $'query {\nproducts(\nquery: {\n  nameConstraint: {\n    in: [\n"0AR6123B__30028E","0AR8107__5017R5","0AR8110__501787","06S9034__903417","06S9002__900211","06E000184__1330L1","06E000184__4920V1","06E000185__1330L1","06S9034__903413","06E000185__1330R1","0AR8118__508973","0AR8118__504281","06E000189__1330L1","06E000190__1330L1","06E000192__4100V1","0AR8120__500187","0AR8120__5026_2","0AR8121__576287","06S9035__903502","06S9035__903507","0AR8121__500187","06S9035__903510","06S9036__903607","0AN3079__706_81","0AN3080__696_6G","06S9003__900309","06S9036__903606","0AN3080__706_81","06E000212__1330L1","0AR8123__500187","0AN3081__501_87","06E000212__1580B1","06S9036__903624" \n        ] }\n    })\n{\n     id: iri\n     names: strings(name:"schema:name")\n     types: refs(name:"rdf:type")\n     urls: refs(name:"schema:url")\n     material: strings(name:"schema:material")\n     category: strings(name:"schema:category")\n     color: strings(name:"schema:color")\n     audience: resources(name:"schema:audience") {\n       audienceType: strings(name:"schema:audienceType")\n    }\n     offers: resources(name:"schema:offers") {\n       price: strings(name:"schema:price")\n    }\n   }\n }'
```

### GraphQL Queries and Pagination

Following are a couple of GraphQL sample queries using pagination (`page` and `rows` parameters).

:::danger

On large datasets, GraphQL queries may take time to load and may timeout. In this case we recommend to use pagination like in the following examples.

### Render Template {#render-template}

When writing a Liquid template, it is helpful to test it with actual data. By providig a `template` and a `data` map, this API will return the rendered prompt:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/renders' -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: text/plain' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>' \
     --data-raw $'...json payload...'
```

This is the example **request** JSON payload:

```json
{
  "template": "...liquid template...",
  "data": {
    "__typename": "Entity",
    "id": "https://data.example.org/example-dataset/gtin",

        "channel": "AB - ABC",
        "styleName": "MyStyleName"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The is an example **response** payload, it is a plain text with the rendition:

```text

The frame color finish is matte. The frame color is matte black. This pair of sunglasses feature lens contrast enhancements. ####
```


#### Render a Collection of Templates

It is also possible to generate multiple renders at once by using the Bulk API:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/renders-collection' -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>' \
     --data-raw $'[...json payload 1...,...json payload 2...,...,...json payload n...]'
```

See [Render Template](#render-template) for the JSON payload structure.

This is an example **response** JSON payload:

```json
[
  ...rendition 1...,
  ...rendition 2...,
  ...,
  ...rendition n...
]
```


### Generate a Preview Completion

It is possible to test different settings by create a completion on the fly:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/completions' -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: text/plain' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>' \
     --data-raw '{"frequency_penalty":0.5,"stop":"###","prompt":"John Smith is a pair of sunglasses. The lens treatment is gradient. The lens color facet is gradient green.

 ```


### Add Word Biases to a Content Generation Project

Once the Project is created and its ID is known, to add Word Biases to a Project use the following API:

```sh
curl 'https://api.wordlift.io/content-generation/content-generations/<project-id>/words/imports' -X PUT \
    -H 'Accept: */*' \
    -H 'content-type: text/csv' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-oauth2-access-token>' \
     --data-raw 'penalize,clear,2867,-3'
```

// File: knowledge-graph/index

# Knowledge Graph

The Knowledge Graph constitutes the basic representation of the Knowledge Domain for a website or an account.

There are several way to populate data in a Knowledge Graph.

In this section you can populate data using:

- URLs by providing a `sitemap.xml` file or manually by using the [Sitemap Import API](./sitemap-import.md) or;
- Crawl data coming from [Botify](./botify.md)

Once the web pages have been imported it is possible to populate the Analytics data by using the [Analytics API](./analytics-api.md). This requires access to Google Search Console and might not be needed if you are using the [Botify Crawl Import](botify.md).

---

// File: knowledge-graph/sitemap-import

# Sitemap Import API

It is possible to jumpstart a Knowledge Graph by importing the URLs from a simple sitemap.xml file (i.e. a sitemap with a list of URLs; sitemap.xml with references to other sitemap files isn't yet supported). It is also possible to specify a list of URLs.

## Import

You can import web pages by providing a `sitemap.xml`` file or a list of URLs.

### Import URLs from a sitemap.xml file

Call the Sitemap import API by specifying the `sitemap.xml` URL in the `sitemap_url` property:

```sh
curl -X "POST" "https://api.wordlift.io/sitemap-imports" \
     -H 'Authorization: Key <key>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
  "sitemap_url": "https://example.org/sitemap.xml"
}'
```

The response is of type [NDJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Newline-delimited_JSON). Each line is a valid JSON with the details about the imported web page.

### Import URLs by providing them to the request

Call the Sitemap import API by specifying a list of URLs `urls` property:

```sh
curl -X "POST" "https://api.wordlift.io/sitemap-imports" \
     -H 'Authorization: Key <key>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
  "urls": [ 
    "https://example.org/file1.html",
    "https://example.org/file2.html",
    "https://example.org/file3.html"
  ]
}'
```

The response is of type [NDJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Newline-delimited_JSON). Each line is a valid JSON with the details about the imported web page.

## Import Analytics data

To import Analytics data see the [Analytics API](./analytics-api.md)

## Query the data

Query the imported data by using the GraphQL endpoint. This is an example GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  entities(
    page: 0
    rows: 1000
  ) {
    id: iri
    headline: string(name: "schema:headline")
    text: string(name: "schema:text")
    types: refs(name: "rdf:type")
    url: string(name: "schema:url")
    seoKeywords: strings(name: "seovoc:seoKeywords")
    topThreeMonthsKeywords: topN(
      name: "seovoc:seoKeywords"
      sort: { field: "seovoc:3MonthsImpressions", direction: DESC }
      limit: 3
    ) {
      name: string(name: "seovoc:name")
      impressions: int(name: "seovoc:3MonthsImpressions")
      clicks: int(name: "seovoc:3MonthsClicks")
    }
    source: strings(name: "seovoc:source")
  }
}
```

# Analytics API

## Introduction

To import analytics data, use the Analytics API, following these steps:

1. Connect the Google Search Console to your Knowledge Graph (Botify is also supported as an alternative to Google Search Console, [inquire with us](https://wordlift.io/contact-us/)).
1. Run the Analytics Import. 

## Authorization

:::info

Using the Analytics API requires a WordLift Key. If you're unsure which one is the WordLift Key for an account, go to [my.wordlift.io](https://my.wordlift.io) and scroll through the list of websites.

:::

## Connect Google Search Console

In order to connect the Google Search Console to your Knowledge Graph, a client needs to perform an interactive authentication and authorization process with Google by using a Web Browser.

### Determine the Resource Id {#determine-the-resource-id}

Each website or domain in Google Search Console has a resource ID. The resource ID is required to configure the Analytics API properly.

To retrieve the resource ID open the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and select the desired website or domain from the left:

![Select Website or Domain](./images/google-search-console-select-website-or-domain.png)

Then select the `resource_id` value:

![Copy and paste the resource ID](./images/google-search-console-copy-paste-the-resource-id.png)

The value is URL encoded, and it requires to be decoded. [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) provides a handy way to decode a URL:

![URL decode the resource ID](./images/google-search-console-use-duckduckgo-to-urldecode-url.png)

Take note of the decoded resource ID, it will be used later (in this example `https://example.org`):

![Copy and paste the decoded resource ID](./images/google-search-console-use-duckduckgo-to-urldecode-url-copy-paste.png)


### Create an Authorization URI

The process starts using a specially crafted URL. To get the URL use the "Build Authorization URI" API (replace `<key>` with your WordLift Key):

```sh
curl -X "POST" "https://api.wordlift.io/google-search-console/oauth2/authorize-uris" \
     -H 'Authorization: Key <key>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
  "redirect_uri": "https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground"
}'
```

:::warning

The `redirect_uri` must be set to `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground`.

:::

This will yield the following response:

```json
{
  "authorize_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Foauthplayground%2F&prompt=consent&response_type=code&client_id=615875160260-bsbm4u5fb2hrke3ln89n33v8rmmksth9.apps.googleusercontent.com&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fwebmasters.readonly&access_type=offline"
}
```

Open the above URL in a Web Browser.

### Authenticate and Authorize with Google

When requested provide your Google e-mail address. The account must be able to access the Google Search Console for the target account:

![Authenticate with Google, by providing your email address](./images/authenticate-with-google.png)

Then provide the password and complete authentication:

![Authenticate with Google, by providing your password](./images/authenticate-with-google.png)

If requested, provide a 2-Step Verification code:

![Authenticate with Google, by providing a 2-Step Verification code](./images/authenticate-with-google.png)

Then finally click "Allow" to authorize the Analytics API to access the Google Search Console data:

![Authorize with Google](./images/authorize-with-google.png)

After clicking "Allow", the browser is redirected to a URL like this:

```
https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/?code=<authorization-code>&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/webmasters.readonly
```

Copy the value in `code=<authorization-code>` (the `<authorization-code>` part) to use it with the Exchange Authorization Code API.

### Create an Authorization Code Exchange

Send the `authorization-code` to the Exchange Authorization Code API:

```sh
curl -X "POST" "https://api.wordlift.io/google-search-console/oauth2/auth-code-exchanges" \
     -H 'Authorization: Key <key>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
  "code": "<authorization-code>",
  "google_search_console_resource_id": "<resource_id>"
}'

```

:::tip

If you don't know the resource ID, see [how to determine the resource ID](#determine-the-resource-id).

:::

If successful, the access token will be stored in the platform and the API will return an empty JSON object:

```json
{
  "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/webmasters.readonly",
  "access_token": "<access-token>",
  "expires_in": 3599,
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "refresh_token": "<refresh-token>"
}
```

## Connect Botify

Botify is also supported as an alternative to Google Search Console, [inquire with us](https://wordlift.io/contact-us/).

:::note

You can only connect one platform at a time.

:::

## Update the Account with the URL

The last step before calling the Analytics import is to configure the website URL:

```sh
## Update Accounts
curl -X "PUT" "https://api.wordlift.io/accounts?key=<key>&url=<url>&country=<country>&language=<language>" \
     -H 'Authorization: Key <key>' \
     -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8'
```

Set the following parameters:

* `key`: is the WordLift key associated with the account
* `url`: is the URL of the target website (in the example above `https://example.org`)
* `country`, optional: the 2 letters country code, e.g. `US`
* `language`, optional: the 2 letters langauge code, e.g. `EN`

If successful the API will response with 200 and the following JSON:

```json
{
  "datasetURI": "https://data.example.org/dataset/",
  "packageType": "<your-package-type>"
}
```

## Call the Analytics Import

Calling the Analytics import is as simple as submitting the following request:

```sh
curl -X "POST" "https://api.wordlift.io/analytics-imports" \
     -H 'Authorization: Key <key>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Replace `<key>` with your WordLift key. The API will import the analytics data for all the URLs published in the Knowledge Graph.

# Botify Crawl Imports

Use the Botify Crawl Imports endpoint (`https://api.wordlift.io/botify-crawl-imports`) to populate a Knowledge Graph with data from Botify.

The import will create Web Pages extracting basic data:

- Headline
- Abstract
- Text
- Url

:::tip

Optionally, the Botify Crawl Import can create embeddings to support Vector Search. If you're interested into this feature, inquire at hello@wordlift.io.

:::

See the [reference](/api/manager/create-botify-crawl-import/) for this API.

## Requirements

Prepare the following data:

- Botify Username
- Botify Project
- Botify Token
- WordLift Key

The Botify data can be found at [botify.com](https://app.botify.com), the folder structure provides the username and the project, e.g. if the project is located at https://app.botify.com/my-user-name/my-project-name/, it means that the Botify Username is _my-user-name_ and that the Botify Project is _my-project-name_. The Botify Token is located in the User Profile screen.

The WordLift Key can be found at [my.wordlift.io](https://my.wordlift.io). If you're unsure how to access the Dashboard, contact us at hello@wordlift.io.

:::info
At the moment is is not possible to configure the Botify parameters from my.wordlift.io, you'll need to contact us at hello@wordlift.io in order for us to perform the configuration.
:::

## How to call the API

Create a POST request to https://api.wordlift.io/botify-crawl-imports. The `Authorization` header is required with the value of `Key __YOUR_WORDLIFT_KEY__`. This is an example request body:

```json
{
  "collection": "crawl.20240127",
  "types": ["CollectionPage"],
  "filters": [
    {
      "field": "crawl.20240127.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_1",
      "predicate": "re",
      "value": "^.+$"
    }
  ],
  "request_embeddings": [
    "http://schema.org/headline",
    "http://schema.org/text"
  ],
  "text": [
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_1",
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_2",
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_3",
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_4",
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_5",
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_6"
  ]
}
```

With this request we tell the API to:

1. Use the Botify collection called `crawl.20240127`.
1. Filter the data by the field `crawl.20240127.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_1`. The Botify filters can be used here.
1. We ask the API to generate embeddings by using the resulting `headline` and `text` properties from the schema.org namespace.
1. We tell the API to generate the `text` property by joining the data present in the `{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_...` Botify property.
1. We also set the target `@type` to `CollectionPage` (the default being `WebPage`).

:::tip
`{collection}` is a placeholder, it is replaced with the value set in `collection`.
:::

This is the complete example CURL:

```shell
## Request
curl -X "POST" "https://api.wordlift.io/botify-crawl-imports" \
     -H 'Authorization: Key __YOUR_WORDLIFT_KEY__' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
  "collection": "crawl.20240127",
  "types": ["CollectionPage"],
  "filters": [
    {
      "field": "crawl.20240127.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_1",
      "value": "^.+$",
      "predicate": "re"
    }
  ],
  "request_embeddings": [
    "http://schema.org/headline",
    "http://schema.org/text"
  ],
  "text": [
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_1",
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_2",
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_3",
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_4",
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_5",
    "{collection}.extract.plp_header_description_extracted_text_part_6"
  ]
}'
```

The API will respond with streaming data of content-type [NDJSON](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec) (`application/x-ndjson`), basically a valid JSON per line:

```json
{"headline":"The headline","text":"The text","image":null,"url":"https://example.org/the-url","date_published":null,"abstract":"The abstract."}
{...}
{...}
{...}
```

:::info
Embeddings are generated asynchronously from a queue, so they may not be immediately available for Vector Search. Depending on the queue size it may take up to an hour for the embeddings to be generated.
:::

## How does the API work

The API will use the provided request to call the Botify endpoint. Although not necessary, it may be helpful to familiarize with [Botify API](https://developers.botify.com/docs/welcome-to-botifys-api-documentation).

It is possible to restrict the data requested from Botify by using the `filters`, which map to Botify's own filters.

The API maps the source data in Botify to semantic data in Knowledge Graph, based on the schema.org vocabulary.

Following are the default mappings:

- `{collection}.metadata.title.content` is mapped to schema.org/headline.
- `{collection}.metadata.description.content` is mapped to schema.org/description.
- `url` is mapped to schema.org/url.

It is possible to customize the default and additional map Botify properties to schema.org/text, to customize:

- schema.org/headline, use the request `headline` property, only one value is accepted.
- schema.org/description, use the request `description` property. An array is provided, the values from the specified properties are joined together.
- schema.org/text, use the request `text` property. As for `description`, an array is provided, the values from the specified properties are joined together.

Moreover by default the generated entity in KG is assigned the `WebPage` type. It is possibile to customize the type by passing it in `types`. An array is provided, all the specified types will be assigned.

The API reads the data from Botify, converts it to semantic data and writes it data to the KG while returning it to the client in a streaming fashion (NDJSON).

// File: knowledge-graph/multilingual

# Multilingual

Each website is linked to a Graph and every Graph is configured with one language and optionally a country.

Multilingual websites can therefore be linked to multiple Graphs each one configured with a specific language.

## Structured Data publishing

Graphs provide the structured data conformant to schema.org, search engine and AI requirements.

Structured data is stored in the form of linked data entities in the Graph. An entity can have a `schema:url` property that it is used to determine which entities (and connected ones) should be publishing for a specific URL.

### Data API

The act of selecting and aggregating this data happens using the Data API which exposes a simple end-point `https://api.wordlift.io/data/https/example.org/page.html`. When calling this end-point, the Data API will return the structured data for the URL `https://example.org/page.html`. The Data API is formatted so that it eases caching by browsers and edge caches in order to boost performance, because it is a simple HTTP GET operation.

In order to know which graph is authoritative for a URL, the Data API queries an internal routing table based on the provided URL, which redirects to the appropriate graph.

When working with multilingual websites, the same path context may refer to a different graph based on the client language, so that another parameter is required to tell the Data API how to select the correct source graph for structured data.

The parameter is called `__wl_lang` and specifies the ISO 639-1 two-letter code for the required language, example `en` for English or `it` for Italian.

For example, the internal routing may have the following configuration, URL example.org is served by:

1. graph <https://data.example.org/en>, which is also the default, when language is English
1. graph <https://data.example.org/it>, when language is Italian

So that when requesting <https://api.wordlift.io/data/https/example.org/page.html?__wl_lang=en>, the Data API will route the request to the <https://data.example.org/en> graph, whereas requesting <https://api.wordlift.io/data/https/example.org/page.html?__wl_lang=it> will route the request to the <https://data.example.org/it> graph.

## Cloud script

The [Cloud](/cloud) script (`bootstrap.js`) will automatically select the correct language by parsing the `html` element's `lang` attribute, for example the `<html lang="en">` tag will tell `bootstrap.js` to request the structured data for the English language, and the script will automatically append the `__wl_lang=en` to the request.

# KG-REST

A RESTful API for interacting with and managing knowledge graphs. KG-REST provides a standardized interface to perform operations on complex graph-based data, making it easier to create, read, update, and delete graph elements while supporting batch processing and query-based interactions.

## Introduction

Welcome to the KG-REST API documentation. KG-REST is designed to seamlessly integrate the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Our goal is to provide developers with a straightforward and intuitive API to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on Knowledge Graphs.

Knowledge Graphs are powerful tools for structuring and interlinking data, enabling complex relationships and insights. However, interacting with them can often be complex and challenging. KG-REST addresses these challenges by offering a RESTful interface, making it easier to manage and manipulate knowledge graph data within your applications.

## Getting Started

We'll assist you in setting up and performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on your Knowledge Graph using two methods:

1. **Using `curl`**
2. **Using the WordLift Python Client**

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **API Key:** An active API key is required for authentication. If you don't have one, please request it from the [WordLift website](https://wordlift.io). he API key is used to authenticate your requests to the KG-REST API.
- **HTTP Client:** Tools like [`curl`](https://curl.se/) can be used to send HTTP requests to the API.
- **Python Environment:** If you prefer using Python, ensure you have Python installed along with the WordLift Python Client.

### Obtaining Your API Key

To interact with the KG-REST API, you'll need an API key:

- **Requesting an API Key:** isit the [WordLift website](https://wordlift.io) and sign up or log in to your account.

### Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.wordlift.io
```

### Authentication

KG-REST uses API keys to authenticate requests. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request:

```
Authorization: Key YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Making Your First Request Using `curl`

Here's how to make a simple `GET` request to retrieve entities from your Knowledge Graph:

**Request:**

```
GET /entities?id=ENTITY_ID
```

**Example using `curl`:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.wordlift.io/entities?id=ENTITY_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Key YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "@id": "ENTITY_ID",
  "@type": "schema:Thing",
  "schema:name": "Entity Name",
  "schema:description": "Entity Description"
}
```

### Using the WordLift Python Client

If you prefer to use Python, follow these steps:

**a. Install the WordLift Python Client:**

```bash
pip install wordlift
```

**b. Initialize the Client:**

```python
import wordlift_client
from wordlift_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.wordlift.io
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = wordlift_client.Configuration(host="https://api.wordlift.io")

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
configuration.api_key["ApiKey"] = (
    "YOUR_API_KEY"
)

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
configuration.api_key_prefix["ApiKey"] = "Key"

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
async with wordlift_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = wordlift_client.EntitiesApi(api_client)

    try:
        # Get
        api_response = await api_instance.create_or_update_entities(
            body="""
            <https://data.wordlift.io/lucky777/01/test> a <http://schema.org/Product>;
                <http://schema.org/description> "Upgrade your Acme Inc. BlastShades™ with precision-engineered BoomVision™ replacement lenses.

            """,
            _content_type="text/turtle",
        )
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling create_or_update_entities: %s\n" % e)

```
# import the necessary modules
from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader, StorageContext
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.vector_stores.wordlift import WordliftVectorStore


# set the openAI key to use GPT as LLM (the default LlamaIndex LLM)
import os
import openai

openai.api_key = os.environ["your_openAI_key"]

# download a sample file and create documents from it
!mkdir 'data\paul_graham\'
!curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt' -O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'

documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham").load_data()


# Wordlift Knowledge Graphs are built on the principles of fully Linked Data,
# where each entity is assigned a permanent dereferentiable URI.

# When adding nodes to an existing Knowledge Graph, it's essential to include
# an "entity_id" in the metadata of each loaded document.

# For further insights into Fully Linked Data, explore these resources:
# [W3C Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html),
# [5 Star Data](https://5stardata.info/en/).

!curl https://api.wordlift.io/accounts/me -H 'Authorization: Key your_key' | jq .

# To generate the entity_id, concatenate the datasetURI with the normalized
# filename.

# For instance, if your datasetURI is `https://data.wordlift.io/wl0000000/` and # your text file is named `sample-file.txt`, the entity_id can be constructed
# as follows:
# `entity_id = datasetURI + normalize(filename)`
# which results in `https://data.wordlift.io/wl0000000/sample-file-txt`.

dataset_uri = "your_dataset_uri"

for document in documents:
 norm_filename = document.metadata["file_name"].replace(".", "-")
 entity_id = dataset_uri + norm_filename
 document.metadata["entity_id"] = entity_id

# Create an instance of Wordlift Vector Store
vector_store = WordliftVectorStore.create("your_key")

# set Wordlift vector store instance as the vector store
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)

index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents, storage_context=storage_context)

# test the vector store query
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("What did the author do growing up?")
print(response)

## Loading Data from the Knowledge Graph
WordLift Reader uses GraphQL, a query language introduced by Facebook, to load data from the knowledge graph. With GraphQL, you can specify exactly what data you need in your LlamaIndex application, eliminating the over-fetching or under-fetching of data that can occur with traditional REST APIs.

To load data from the knowledge graph, you need to construct a GraphQL query.

Here are a few examples of queries that you can use to get started:

### Products
```
query {
  products(page: 0, rows: 100) {
    id: iri
    url: strings(name: "schema:url")
    gtin: strings(name: "schema:gtin")
    names: strings(name: "schema:name")
    description: strings(name: "schema:description")
    brand: resource(name: "schema:brand") {
      brand: string(name: "schema:name")
    }
    price: resource(name: "schema:offers") {
      price: string(name: "schema:price")
    }
    image: string(name: "schema:image")
  }
}
```
### FAQs
```
query {
  faqPages {
    url: string(name: "schema:url")
    title: string(name: "schema:name")
    questions: resources(name: "schema:mainEntity") {
      question: string(name: "schema:name")
      answer: resources(name: "schema:acceptedAnswer") {
        text: string(name: "schema:text")
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Articles
```
query {
  articles(page: 0, rows: 25) {
    id: iri
    title: string(name: "schema:headline")
    date: string(name: "schema:datePublished")
    author_id: string(name: "schema:author")
    article_author: resource(name: "schema:author") {
      id: iri
      name: string(name: "schema:name")
    }
    article_url: string(name: "schema:mainEntityOfPage")
    article_about: resource(name: "schema:about") {
      names: string(name: "schema:name")
    }
    article_desc: string(name: "schema:description")
    mentions: resources(name: "schema:mentions") {
      names: strings(name: "schema:name")
    }
    body: string(name: "wordpress:content")
  }
}
```

🚨 Be aware that data inside your knowledge graph might have a different structure and you might need to adapt these queries. Always look at the URI behind each entity (iri) to make sure you fully understand how data is organized.

Once you have constructed the query, you can submit it to the WordLift Reader, which will retrieve the specified data from the knowledge graph and pass it to LlamaIndex for creating the indices.

# WordLift Looker Studio Connector

With the [WordLift Looker Studio Connector](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wordlift-data-studio-connector/), you can **create semantic SEO reports** by loading data from your Knowledge Graph directly into Looker Studio and merging it with Search Console or any other web analytics platform.

## Get Started

### 1. Search for it

The first step to start creating your semantic SEO report is to search for WordLift on the [Google Looker Studio connectors page](https://datastudio.google.com/datasources).

![image](../images/wordlift-datastudio-connector-get-started.png)

```{raw} html <video controls src="https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/semantic-seo-report.mp4"></video>
```

Just click on it and **enter the WordLift key**.

We have a GraphQL query ready for you, so you don’t need to do anything to get started. In case you are a power user and you know the query that you want to run, just continue. For example, if you are running an e-commerce website, maybe you want to query for product attributes or prices. Then be sure to keep checking the box “use report template for new report”, so you can get a shiny new report premade for you.

Then click **Connect**. Here you can see the fields that come from the report. Finally, click **Create Report**.

![image](../images/wordlift-datastudio-connector-create-report.png)

### 2. Add GSC as a data source and check the blend

At this point, you are close to creating your report, but two more steps are needed:

1. To go to the managed data sources and add your Search Console data source: choose your website, choose URL Impressions and choose Web Type, and then click on Create.
2. Check the blends to verify that the data is merged from the Knowledge Graph and GSC.

![image](../images/wordlift-datastudio-connector-check.png)

You can filter the data for EntityType and choose the period of time you prefer.

# WordLift Power Automate Connector

The [WordLift Power Automate Connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/wordliftgraphql/) allows you to **integrate your Knowledge Graph data with the Microsoft Power Platform**. This connector provides access to the WordLift GraphQL API, enabling you to extract and utilize entity data across Power Automate, Logic Apps, and Power Apps.

## Availability

The connector is available in the following products and regions:

### Logic Apps

- **Class:** Standard
- **Regions:** All Logic Apps regions except:
  - Azure Government regions
  - Azure China regions
  - US Department of Defense (DoD)

### Power Automate

- **Class:** Premium
- **Regions:** All Power Automate regions except:
  - US Government (GCC)
  - US Government (GCC High)
  - China Cloud operated by 21Vianet
  - US Department of Defense (DoD)

### Power Apps

- **Class:** Premium
- **Regions:** All Power Apps regions except:
  - US Government (GCC)
  - US Government (GCC High)
  - China Cloud operated by 21Vianet
  - US Department of Defense (DoD)

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need:

- A WordLift subscription
- A Knowledge Graph and its related access key
- Basic GraphQL knowledge

## Authentication

The connector uses API Key authentication. You'll need to provide your WordLift Knowledge Graph key in the format:

```
Key YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

For example, if your key is `123`, you would enter: `Key 123`

To obtain your key:

1. Go to [my.wordlift.io](https://my.wordlift.io)
2. Your available keys will be displayed on the home page

## Using the Connector

### Getting Started

1. Add the WordLift connector to your automation
2. Provide your authentication key (prefixed with `Key`)
3. Create your GraphQL query
4. Use the returned data in your automation scenario

### Example Query

Here's a sample query to get you started:

```graphql
query {
    entities(rows: 100, page: 0) {
        headline: string(name:"schema:headline")
        description: string(name:"schema:description")
        url: string(name:"schema:url")
    }
}
```

### Known Limitations

When querying a Knowledge Graph with large amounts of data, use the `rows` and `page` parameters to limit the results to a specific subset:

```graphql
query {
  entities(page: 0, rows: 100) {
    // your fields here
  }
}
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthenticated | Check that you've provided the authentication key |
| 403 Access Denied | Verify your key is valid and includes the `Key` prefix |
| Timeouts | Add `rows` and `page` parameters to limit result size |

## Throttling Limits

| Limit Type | Calls | Renewal Period |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| API calls per connection | 100 | 60 seconds |

# Analysis

**WordLift** suggests to the content editor relevant fact-based information, images and links to organize and enrich contents.

**WordLift** analyses articles using *Named Entity Recognition* (NER) and *Named Entity Disambiguation* (NED) to extract [Named Entities](/pages/key-concepts#entity) from posts and pages.

Entities, used for annotating contents, belong to different [knowledge graphs](/pages/key-concepts#knowledge-graph) or [custom vocabularies](/pages/key-concepts#vocabulary) including but not limited to DBpedia, GeoNames and Freebase.

WordLift creates and publishes annotations as [linked open data](/pages/key-concepts#linked-open-data).

## Content Writing

To start working with WordLift (once the plugin has been properly [installed](/wordpress-plugin/getting-started#installation) and [configured](/wordpress-plugin/getting-started#configuration)) you can simply start writing a blog post using the [standard visual editor of WordPress](https://en.support.wordpress.com/visual-editor).

WordLift adds to the visual editor the Widgets Menu to embed [widgets](/pages/key-concepts#widget) in page.

![image](./images/wordlift-menu.png)

:::caution Warning
WordLift is designed for the standard **WordPress visual editor**.
**WordLift also offers experimental support for Visual Builders. Contact us to test your specific install**.
:::

:::info Note
You can decide to switch WordLift's analysis ON and OFF by clicking on the *open|close* arrow on the top right corner of the WordLift's Edit widget.
:::

![image](./images/wl_toggle_3-13-3.gif)

## WordLift Widgets Menu

The menu lets you add five different [widgets](/pages/key-concepts#widget) to your blog post.\` Widgets \<key-concepts#widget>\`\_ provide a rich visual presentation of the entities populating the post and help readers find more relevant contents.

:::info Note
As the site grows with new articles, new entities are created and contents are annotated, the graphical widgets automatically reflect the changes **without requiring any intervention from the editor**. This brings fresh new updates on your contents.
:::

The five [widgets](/pages/key-concepts#widget) are:

- **Chord**
  : Visualizes the relationships between all entities starting from entities mentioned in the post.
- **Timeline**
  : Displays a chronological and navigable list of entities marked as *Event* mentioned in the post.
- **GeoMap**
  : Displays  on a map all entities of type *Place*  mentioned in the post.
- **Navigator**
  : Provides content recommendations by presenting relevant **internal** links to other blog posts on the same website.
- **Faceted Search Widget**
  : Provides a faceted search user interface to help readers find relevant articles using the network of entities.

Each widget has a corresponding shortcode; review the [widget shortcodes page](/pages/shortcodes#widget-shortcodes) for more information on how this works.

## Analysing the text

As you begin to write the content on the post, WordLift automatically starts analysing it.

Once you hit the **Save Draft** button *for the first time*, [entities](/pages/key-concepts#entity) are extracted and underlined.

![image](./images/wordlift-content-analysis-results.png)

By clicking on each entity you can [reconcile](/pages/key-concepts#reconciliation) it with the same entity in DBpedia or Freebase using the [WordLift Edit Post Widget](#wordlift-edit-post-widget)(#wordlift-edit-post-widget). The entities that you choose will annotate this blog post.

:::info Note
Text annotation in WordLift is *semi-automatic*. [Entities](/pages/key-concepts#entity) being extracted automatically must be validated by the editor before being recorded.
:::

With WordLift you can identify the basic '*who*, *what*, *when* and *where*' of an
article. You can also further structure the contextual information by creating new entities in the [custom vocabulary](/pages/key-concepts#vocabulary). Annotations are added to posts and pages using the **WordLift Edit Post Widget**.

### WordLift Edit Post Widget

Articles can be annotated in two ways:

- **Top down**: entities are organized using the '*who*, *what*, *when* and *where*' categories **regardless of where each entity appears in the text**. When you choose an entity using the **top down** approach **all occurrences of that entity are annotated**.
- **Bottom up**: entities are annotated and organized using the '*who*, *what*, *when* and *where*' categories **starting from each specific occurence of the entity in the text**. When you choose an entity using the **bottom up** approach **only the choosen occurrence of that entity is annotated**.

#### Top down annotation

The content editor, from the list of entities being detected in the text, uses these entities to describe his/her post without selecting any specific occurrence in the text.
Entities being selected, in this case, describe the entire post (and not the single occurrence of the entity in the text).

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-post-widget-01.png)

#### Bottom up annotation

The content editor has choosen the “Expo 2015” occurence in the text. In this case, this specific occurrence, is annotated with the entity "Expo 2015".

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-post-widget-02.png)

#### Edit Entity Properties

The content editor is editing the main properties for the entity "Expo 2015" while writing the post.
The complete list of properties can be edited clicking on the "open in vocabulary" link (see [Edit Entity](/pages/edit-entity) page.)

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-post-widget-03.png)

#### Image Suggestor

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-post-widget-04.png)

Images for each entity appear in the WordLift Edit Post Widget and can be embedded in the visual editor.

## Reconciling entities

![image](./images/wordlift-content-analysis-disambiguation-start.png)

Let's choose as relevant entity in this example *\[Web\]*, as the post is referring to the World Wide Web. As the entity type for *\[Web\]* is a `Thing` the entity appears under the *what* category.

:::info Note
[Reconciling](/pages/key-concepts#reconciliation) entities means **linking** the entity appearing in this text with its own equivalent on other sources (i.e. DBpedia or Freebase).
:::

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-post-widget-05.png)

Using the [WordLift Edit Post Widget](#wordlift-edit-post-widget) you can now read the following parameters:

- **Entity Title** the name of the entity
- **Entity Category** the type of entity according to the `schema.org` vocabulary
- **Entity Description** the description of the entity

All parameters but the Title can be edited directly from the [WordLift Edit Post Widget](#wordlift-edit-post-widget)(#wordlift-edit-post-widget)

:::info Note
Data being used for the enrichments comes from openely avaialble sources
like DBpedia that might contain misleading information that the editor can alwasy edit.

Entity properties can also be edited clicking on the "open in vocabulary" link (see [Edit Entity](/pages/edit-entity) page.)
:::

Once you hit **Save** you are annotating this post which means adding a [semantic fingerprint](/pages/key-concepts#semantic-fingerprint) to this piece of content.

In this post another important entity worth mentioning is the creator of the World Wide Web Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
The entity is properly identified as `Person` and all `Person` and `Organization` types are available under the *who* category.

![image](./images/wordlift-content-analysis-disambiguation-berners-lee.png)

:::info Note
Annotations are saved when a blog post or a page is published. Annotations and data related to each entity being annotated remain in *draft* untill the post is published.
:::

:::caution Warning
When the text from the Visual Editor is edited or removed all annotations being saved are lost. WordLift stores the editor's selection of entities in the content of the Visual Editor.
:::

## Creating a new entity

The purpose of using WordLift is to (1) categorize your content, (2) help people find content of interest to them, and (3) help WordLift describe your contents in *machine-readable* format so that other computers can re-use it.

In some cases key concepts that are important for (1), (2) and (3) are not automatically detected by WordLift and need to be taught by creating new entities.

:::info Note
A basic guideline for adding entity is: people should apply entities the same way a librarian would plausibly use tags to classify the content you're writing if it was a book. For some basic guidelines on when creating new entities [read here](/pages/faq#what-are-the-guidelines-for-creating-new-entities-to-annotate-a-blog-post-or-a-page).
:::

New entities being added will become part of the [WordLift vocabulary](/pages/key-concepts#vocabulary).

Once an entity as been added to the vocabulary it will be automatically detected every-time you mention it again in your contents.

In our example one significant entity has not been detected and it is worth *teaching* it to WordLift.

![image](./images/wordlift-content-analysis-new-entity-highlight.gif)

The entity is *\[WordLift\]* itself. To create a new entity simply highlight the text `WordLift`, then click the button **Create New Entity** at the top of the [WordLift Edit Post Widget](#wordlift-edit-post-widget) and by clicking it you will be then able to edit the properties of the new entity.

![image](./images/wordlift-content-analysis-new-entity-creation.png)

Choose the category *Creative Work* (it also applies to *Software*), add a description and hit the "Save" button. Now the new entity will appear as [related entities](/pages/key-concepts#related-entities)  of the blog post along with *\[Web\]* and *\[Tim Berners-Lee\]*.

![image](./images/wordlift-content-analysis-new-entity-creation2.png)

:::caution Warning
When creating a new entity over **an existing annotation**: a) remove the annotated entity, b) re-write the entity and c) create a new one (as described above). See animation below.
:::

![image](./images/wl-new-entity-specific-case.gif)

You can now continue to the [Edit Entity](/pages/edit-entity) page.

# Discover

**WordLift** brings to the readers of your site multiple means of **content discovery**.

**WordLift** leverages on the semantic network of concepts (or [entities](/pages/key-concepts#entity)) being created to help users explore the content of your site.

Using the [graph](/pages/key-concepts#knowledge-graph) created by **WordLift** innovative ways of navigating the contents can be implemented (this is particularly true if you are a developer.)

**WordLift** helps users discover content in **eight different ways**:

1. **Links to Entity Pages**: linking annotated entities, now also features a Context Card presenting a preview of the concept;
2. **Navigator Widget**: providing links to other blog posts related to the article;
3. **Faceted Search Widget**: helping users discover related content using other entities;
4. **Timeline Widget**: creating beautiful and interactive timelines;
5. **Geomap widget**: displaying entities of type "Place" on a map;
6. **Chord Widget**: providing a quick overview of the network of concepts related to an article;
7. **Entity Cloud Widget**: presenting the list of entities mentioned in the article;
8. **Glossary Widget**: presenting entities in alphabetical order.

## Links to Entity Pages

**Entity Links** are useful for three reasons:

1. They allow users to navigate the website
2. They help establish information hierarchy using the network of entities
3. They could help spread link juice (ranking power) around the websites for better SEO.

![image](./images/wordlift-discover-entity-links.png)

These links can be personalised using the CSS class `wl-entity-page-link`. As seen in the example NASA is a link to an entity page while Mars is a normal link to an external webpage.

### Context Cards

**Context Cards** provide an immediate preview of an entity. If the entity has been annotated and, if links are active,
WordLift will show a preview of the annotated entity.

By default context cards will show up on *hovering* if [Links to Entity Pages](#links-to-entity-pages) are enabled.
To disable context cards, add the following code to your theme:

```php
add_filter('wl_context_cards_show' '__return_false')
```

```{image} https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5725682/60662170-f4ee9600-9e5b-11e9-8a06-368eede8b89e.png
```

:::info Note
Based on the original work of [Wikipedia Context Cards](https://github.com/joakin/context-cards).
:::

## The Navigator Widget

The **Navigator Widget** provides content recommendations by presenting relevant links to other blog posts on your website.

![image](./images/wordlift-discover-navigator.png)

Each tile presents a **link to a semantically related blog post** (and optionally a **link to an entity**).
The template for the **Navigator Widget** can be modified and styled as per the theme UI.

## The Faceted Search Widget

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-faceted-search-widget-frontend.gif)

Users can choose multiple concepts to drill down the list of articles related to them.

The default title for this widget - when it is added to a page - is "**Related articles**". This title be customised by adding the new title in the shortcode as shown in the example below.

```html
[wl_faceted_search title="this is my new title"]
```

## The Timeline Widget

**WordLift** uses the powerful [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) to create beautiful, interactive timelines.
The timeline widget in **WordLift** uses nothing more than [entities of type event](/pages/edit-entity#edit-an-event) mentioned and annotated in the article.

[Entities of type event](/pages/edit-entity#edit-an-event) can be linked to entities of type place via the property *location* (this describe where the event is taking place). If a place is mentioned in the article and it is linked to an event the timeline will display this event also.

![image](./images/wordlift-shortcodes-timeline.png)

:::info Note
In order for an event to appear in the timeline the event property *startDate* shall be present as illustrated [here](/pages/edit-entity#edit-an-event).
:::

It is possible to personalise the layout of the timeline using any of [the presentation options of TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/options.html) plus three additional parameters provided by WordLift:

1. **excerpt_length** let's you control the lenght of text (in number of characters) displayed for each event (this corresponds to the description of the entity)
2. **display_images_as** the default value is *media*, alternatively you can use *background* and the fetured image of the entity will be used as background
3. **global** when set to *true* the timeline displays events mentioned in the latest posts (no need to add mentions to places or events in this case).

:::info Note
When you create a timeline with WordLift you can pass in the shortcode optional parameters to set a variety of presentation options. These are derived from the TimelineJS library [read more here](https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/options.html).
:::

```html
[wl_timeline display_images_as='background' height='600px' excerpt_length=25 global='true']
```

This shortcode above produces the following result:

### The Timeline WordPress Widget

The **Timeline WordPress Widget** is a site-wide Widget that displays events being saved as entities (type event) using the [interactive timeline](#the-timeline-widget).

![image](./images/wordlift-timeline-wordpress-widget.png)

## The Geomap Widget

The **Geomap Widget** displays entities of type "Place" mentioned in the article on a Geomap.

![image](./images/wordlift-shortcodes-geomap.png)

## The Chord Widget

The **Chord Widget** visualizes the relations between entities within a given article.

![image](./images/wordlift-shortcodes-chord.png)

User might choose to navigate to an entity page or to another blog post.

## The Entity Cloud Widget

The **Entity Cloud Widget** is a site-wide Widget and a shortcode that displays entities related to the current post/entity in a tag cloud. WordPress Widgets like this one add content and features to your Sidebars. To add the widget:

1. Go to **Appearance > Customize** in the WordPress Administration Screens.
2. Click the **Widget** menu in the Theme Customizer to access to the Widget Customize Screen.

![image](./images/wordlift-entities-cloud-widget.png)

It is possible, just like for other WordPress Widgets to personalize the title of the Widget. This widget can also be added to an article or a page with the following shortcode:

```html
[wl_cloud]
```

## The Glossary Widget

The **Glossary** is a site-wide Widget that displays all the entities in alphabetical order.

```html
[wl_vocabulary limit=... type=... orderby=...]
```

By default the widget takes into account the latest 100 entities from all types (i.e. Person, Place, Organization, ...).
The following paramenters can be used to personalise the entities beind displayed in the vocabulary:

1. **limit** the total number of entities to displaye (*100* is the defualt value). Use `limit='-1'` to remove the limit.
2. **type** the type of entities to display (*all* is the default value). Use `type='Person'` to display only entities of type Person.
3. **orderby** the selection is by default related to the alphabetical order (*title* is the default value).
4. **cat** the selection is done using the WordPress Category ID (the category shall be associated to a set of entities). Read here [how to find the Category ID](http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-find-post-category-tag-comments-or-user-id-in-wordpress/).

# Edit Entity

**WordLift** uses [entities](/pages/key-concepts#entity) to annotate and organize blog posts and pages.
All entities can be edited using the [WordLift Edit Post widget](/pages/analysis#wordLift-edit-post-widget) or from the **Entity Page** itself. To access all entities or add a new entity click on the **Vocabolary** icon on the dashboard menu.

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-vocabulary.png)

When annotating a post with an entity WordLift adds a link to the **entity page**.
These links are useful for three reasons:

1. They allow users to navigate the website
2. They help establish information hierarchy using the network of entities
3. They could help spread link juice (ranking power) around the websites for better SEO.

Curating **entity pages** with WordLift is similar to writing an article on [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org). These *entity posts* are useful for:

- Providing contextual information to articles
- Aggregate all contents referring to the same entity

## Edit entity properties

The entity page provides the following set of properties that can be edited from the corresponding *meta box*:

> - **Name:** the title of the article
> - **Description:** the body of the article
> - **Image:** the featured image of the article
> - **Entity Types:** the corresponding type (i.e. *Thing*, *Person*, *Place*, *Event*, *Organization*, *Creative Work*, ...) that can be managed via the *WordLift - Entity Type* box in the editing window
> - **Permalink:** the URL describing the entity
> - **Same-As:** the URLs of same entity on the different sources

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-informations.png)

### Edit an Event

Events, occuring in a specific time are also entities. To personalise the *startDate*, *endDate* and *location* of an event you can use the **Event Properties** box.

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-event.png)

It is also possible to link an event with the *performer* (a presenter, a musician, or a group of speakers) by adding a reference to either a Person or an Organization.

Event can also be linked with an Offer - *this is an entity type* - that help us define for example the price for the tickets to an event.

### Edit a Place

Places are also entities. To personalise the *geo coordinates* (longitude and latitude) of a place I can use the **Coordinates** box and either edit the *Latitude* and *Longitude* fields or simply place the pinpoint on the map.

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-place.png)

### Edit a Recipe

Recipes are also considered entities. To personalise *ingredients*, *cuisine*, *preparation time*, *cooking time*, *total time*, *number of portions*, *author* and *calories* I can edit the data using the Recipe meta boxes (make sure to choose the entity type *Recipe* in order to see these additional fields).

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-recipe-01.png)

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-recipe-02.png)

### Edit a Offer

An offer can be linked from an event and it helps us define for instance the pricing of an event.

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-offer.png)

## Updating the description

When we have something meanigful to say on a specific concept **we shall curate the information and edit the data that has been fetched automatically by WordLift** (*this will create our own version of Wikipedia*).

## Linking other entities

Entity pages can be annotated just like you would do with a blog posts.

After saving the new description you wrote, WordLift will analyze the text and suggest related entities. You can now *link* an entity with other entities. WordLift will store these relationships between one entity and other entities in the [graph](/pages/key-concepts#knowledge-graph) using the Dublin Core property `dct:related`. This information will be used to infer new connections between the contents of the site. For more information on *entity linking* [read the faq](/pages/faq#when-should-i-link-one-entity-to-another).

## The Faceted Search Widget

**Entity pages** can be used for helping users browse the content of your website. This is done using the **Faceted Search Widget**.
The Widget can be added on the entity page using the **Faceted Search** option from the [Widgets Dropodown Menu](/pages/analysis#wordlift-widgets-menu)

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-faceted-search-widget.png)

Alternatively, the `[wl_faceted_search]` shortcode can be used.

- **Faceted Search**
  : Provides a faceted search user interface to help readers discover relevant articles using the network of entities.

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-faceted-search-widget-frontend.gif)

The example above represents the widget displayed in the front-end. The reader can select multiple concepts and highlight the list of articles related to these concepts.

## Save data

In order to save the information on the entity press the "Publish" button.
When making changes to an already existing entity press the "Update" button. In both cases data will be stored simultaneously on the WordPress site as well as in the [graph](/pages/key-concepts#knowledge-graph).

You can now continue to the [publish](/pages/publish) page.

[creativework]: http://schema.org/CreativeWork
[event]: http://schema.org/Event

# Who is WordLift for?

**WordLift** is for all *bloggers*, *journalists*, and *content marketers* publishing and fighting for readers’ attention on the web.
**WordLift** democratizes the field, bringing to the hands of all web content creators the technology that web publisher giants such as *Google*, *Facebook* and the *BBC* are using to organize and monetize their content.
**WordLift** helps you create richer and more engaging content, optimizes it for all search engines and efficiently organizes your content creation process, allowing you to reach and speak directly to your tribe.

## Why shall I use WordLift?

Organizing web content around an internal vocabulary rather than traditional web pages helps both users and machines finding and accessing it, improving navigation, content re-use, content repurposing, and search engine rankings.
**WordLift** **organizes** content, reducing the complexity of content management and content marketing operations, letting bloggers and site owners focus on stories and communities.
**WordLift** **enriches** your content with *contextual information*, *links*, and *media*, from custom vocabularies and/or the wealth of open data available on the web, bringing your user experience to a new level of engagement.
**WordLift** **connects** content with cross-media *discovery* and *recommendations* widgets, increasing content quality, exposure, trustworthiness and readership engagement.
**WordLift** **optimizes** content, complementing the offer of plug-ins such as *SEO Ultimate +* or *Yoast*, automatically adding [schema markup](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/schema-org/) to your text, allowing all search engines to properly index your pages and deliver more traffic to your site.

## How does it work?

:::info Note
To know more about how **WordLift** works, please [watch the step by step video tutorials](https://wordlift.io/how-it-works/) on our [website](https://wordlift.io).
:::

**WordLift** works in subsequent stages.

1. The first step provides a **full text analysis** and suggests concepts and relationships found in open vocabularies (such as *DBpedia*, *Wikidata*, *GeoNames*, etc) to help writers **classify** and **enrich** their content and structure it for search engines like Google, according to schema.org vocabulary.
2. Writers can then create new entities, to complement the ones suggested automatically, and to be published as part of a **proprietary vocabulary**, acting both as a **reference** and a **search magnet** for their readers, according to the editorial plans.
3. **WordLift** also assists writers suggesting **links**, **media** and providing a set of powerful **visualization widgets** to connect and recommend alternative content, to boost readers’ engagement.
4. Finally **WordLift** provides means to record all these relationships in a graph database allowing search queries like *“find all contents related to concept_y and relevant for target_z”*.

## What are the languages supported by WordLift?

WordLift currently supports 32 languages: Chinese, Danish, German, English, French, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish, Albanian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Ukrainian.

:::info Note
WordLift supports one language at the time. The main language of the website can be configured from the WordLift settings.
Review the [configuration settings](/wordpress-plugin/getting-started#configuration) for more information.
:::

## Is there a free trial?

Yes! All of our subscriptions come with a **14-day free trial**. If after two weeks you are not happy with WordLift, [contact us](mailto:support@wordlift.io) and we will cancel your subscription, no questions asked.
In addition, with the purchase of our 12-month packages, we offer 20% discount. [Check it out](https://wordlift.io/pricing)!

## Who owns the structured metadata created with WordLift?

**You do!** We believe content creators should retain the commercial value of their content and all the data they create and exploit it through **new business models** based on **content syndication**, **data-as-a-service** and a stronger **relationship with their audience**. You can open your datasets to the public, attaching to it a free or a commercial licence. Otherwise, use your data to feed **chat bots** such as Facebook Messenger or Telegram, providing live feed updates on your activity and/or automatic customer service in real time.

## What happens if I stop using WordLift?

1. If you stop paying for your subscription, but keep the plugin on your site, all the entities, metadata and pages you created with wordlift will still be available on your site - you won't be able to update it any longer, but they will still work just fine as they were at the moment you removed the key. The data you’ve created belongs to you and you can always request to us a data dump that is available in various machine-readable formats.
2. if you deactivate the plugin instead, the vocabulary (metadata, entity and pages) will disappear from your dashboard, but everything you created is stored in your website Database in WordPress, and you will be able to download it, transfer it or re-activate it again anytime from the plugin menu.
3. Turning off WordLift on our side, it would be like turning off all the keys and un-publish all the linked data you’ve created, not the plug-in itself, so it will be like ##1 - you could get the data back from us and re-publish it as [linked data](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/linked-data/) on your own infrastructure.
4. WordLift's technology is entirely open source: it takes development skills, infrastructure and some wisdom to nicely bring all the pieces together without our support.
5. Your vocabulary (article metadata and entities) are published as [linked data](/pages/key-concepts#linked-open-data) and you can always request a data dump in any of the following formats: RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, JSON-LD.

## Is WordLift Secure?

Security has been a consideration from day one. We have worked for many years in high-security environments such as parliaments and telco operators and we leverage on all of our experience to protect the data of our users.

#### So, what are some of the ways we do this?

- WordLift plugin and front end only use [SSL](http://info.ssl.com/article.aspx?id=10241).
- Your data from the WordLift store is in a dedicated database, with access granted only to the WordLift store web site account originating from the WordLift store network address.
- Keys for accessing your account page are transmitted securely over SSL and encrypted from the moment we receive them.
- Any data transmitted between WordLift and our server farm is done over SSL.
- Your data is **not shared with or handled by** any other services or companies, with the exception of the data published as open data.
- WordLift itself is a small team, which limits the number of people with any access to your data.
- There are regular security reviews of all WordLift servers and components.
- You can ask us to delete your account information at any time. Contact us by by [email](mailto:hello-gdpr@wordlift.io), or by [making a request here](https://wordlift.gdprform.io/).

If you have any other questions, concerns, or want to clarify anything listed on this page, please let us know.

## Why and how should I customize the url of the entity pages created in my vocabulary?

When selecting or creating new entities with WordLift, you are actively [building your internal vocabulary](https://wordlift.io/8-rules-create-vocabulary-wordpress-website/), adding pages to your website. When you first built your website, you chose a pattern for the url of the pages you were going to add, such as www.domain.com/name-of-the-page or www.domain.com/seo-keyword/name-of-the-page.
The same applies with all the pages created with WordLift inside your vocabulary.

1. By default WordLift will add the word “vocabulary” between your root domain and the name of the page: www.domain.com/vocabulary/name-of-the-entity-page.
2. You can delete the word vocabulary if you want the new entity page to be inside your root domain folder: www.domain.com/name-of-the-entity-page.
3. Or you can replace vocabulary with another keyword (or keywords) of your choice, for SEO or branding reason: www.domain.com/seo-keyword/name-of-the-entity-page.

## Why is it important to organize my content and publish it as Linked Data?

Organizing web content around concepts rather than traditional web pages helps both users and machines finding and accessing it, improves **navigation**, **content re-use**, **content repurposing** and **search engine rankings**.
**Enriching content** with *contextual information*, *links* and *media*, from custom vocabularies and/or the wealth of **open data** available on the web, brings the user experience to a new level of engagement.
Structuring content with **richer metadata** and publishing it as [linked data](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/linked-data/) makes it **discoverable and searchable**, providing new ways of reaching targets.

## Why is WordLift innovative?

**WordLift** is **first-to-market** following a **“content organization” approach** which allows the classification and direct exploitation of proprietary content and structured metadata.
**Wordlift** helps publishers create their **knowledge graph**, *exploit it* and *monetize it*.

Finally **WordLift** complements the offer of plug-ins such as *SEO Ultimate +* or *Yoast* automatically adding [schema markup](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/schema-org/) to content, allowing search engines to properly index pages, increasing traffic from organic searches.

## What is content enrichment?

Content enrichment is a processes used to refine and improve textual content by embedding structured data (*metadata*) on web pages. This *metadata* is made available to search engines and other data consumers.

## What entity types are supported and how they map to Schema.org?

*Thing*, *Person*, *Place*, *Event*, *Organization*, *LocalBusiness*, *Creative Work* and *Recipe* are the supported types.
Review the [Edit Entity page](/pages/edit-entity##entity-types-and-properties-table) for more information.

## When should I create a new entity?

You should create a new entity when this is directly relevant to the content you're writing and it doesn't already exist. When an entity is properly recognised by WordLift you shall edit this entity rather then creating a new one.

You can add as many entities as you like.

## What are the guidelines for creating new entities to annotate a blog post or a page?

A basic guideline for adding a new entity is:

> "*people should create entities that a librarian would plausibly use to classify the content as if it was a book.*"

The purpose of using WordLift is to (1) categorize your content, (2) help people find content of interest to them, and (3) help WordLift describe your contents in *machine-readable* format so that other computers can re-use it.

In some cases key concepts that are important for (1), (2) and (3) are not automatically detected by WordLift and need to be taught. To teach WordLift new concepts a new entity shall be created.

:::info Note
When entities already exist on a website in the form of posts or pages we shall always avoid creating a new entity and instead turn these posts or pages into entities. [Here is how](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wordlift-3-15/).
:::

People should add entities that are accurate and directly relevant to the content they're writing.

Excessively broad entities should not be added to content.

Content should not be overloaded with entities to increase its distribution online. As a general guideline, 6–8 entities should be adequate for most blog posts (based on the lenght of the article). If an article has too many entities it may be that some of the entities could be replaced with a single broader entity.

All entities shall be matched to the proper language of the content. There are two important articles to read on this topic:

1. [8 Rules To Create A Vocabulary For Your WordPress Website](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/8-rules-create-vocabulary-wordpress-website/)
2. [Entity Based SEO: How To Optimize Your Entity Vocabulary](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/use-vocabulary/)

## How can I search for the equivalent entity in the web of data?

A published datasets like the knowledge graph that users create with WordLift shall link to other existing datasets using the OWL `owl:sameAs` property. This property creates an equivalence class between two nodes of an RDF graph. [Tim Berners Lee](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/tim-berners-lee/) in his "Linked Data" note of 2006 outlined 4 principles of [linked data](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/linked-data/):

1. Use URIs to name (identify) things.
2. Use HTTP URIs so that these things can be looked up (interpreted, "dereferenced").
3. Provide useful information about what a name identifies when it's looked up, using open standards such as RDF, SPARQL, etc.
4. Refer to other things using their HTTP URI-based names when publishing data on the Web.

Specifically the **4th linked data principle** is meant to ensure a Web of data and not just a set of unconnected data islands. WordLift during the analysis automatically interlinks all detected entities with several datasets (DBpedia, Yago, Freebase etc.) but what if we are creating a new entity from scratch? How can we find an equivalent resource in the Web of linked data?

There are basically four ways of doing it. The goal is to provide an information that can be understood by semantic search engines like Google, Bing and Yandex:

1. **use WordLift sameAs search box**. WordLift will look for entities in Wikidata, DBpedia and on the datasets configured behind the WordLift key for the equivalent entity. This feature has been introduced with WordLift 3.15 [learn more about this feature here](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wordlift-3-15/).
2. **ask Google Search** a query by adding "site:dbpedia.org" to the name of the entity (ie "*site:dbpedia.org apache marmotta*"). Google will provide a list of results, chose the URL that start with *dbpedia.org/page/* (ie *dbpedia.org/page/Apache_Marmotta*), replace `/page/` with `/resource/` and you will have the `owl:sameAs` link to be added to your entity;
3. **look for the entity in Wikidata** by using the search bar on the [wikidata](https://wikidata.org) website. The search bar is on the top right corner. The URL for the equivalent entity of Apache Marmotta in Wikidata is *https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16928009*;
4. **use the Google Knowledge Graph Search API** (here is [a link](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/) to the documentation by Google). You will need an API Key from Google. Using your personal API key you will be able to search the Google Knowledge Graph with simple HTTP request. Here is an example `https://kgsearch.googleapis.com/v1/entities:search?query=andrea+volpini&key=API_KEY&limit=1&indent=True` (simply replace `API_KEY` with your personal API Key). The API responds with a [JSON LD](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/json-ld/); look for the `machine id` that is located under `itemListElement` > `result` > `@id`. This should be something like `kg:/m/0djtw2h` now take the id and rewrite it by adding in front *http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/* than replace `/m/` with `/m.` and you should have something like: *http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0ndhxqz*.

:::info Note
While Freebase no longer exists the `machine id` remains valid. We prefer to have such links in the `owl:sameAs` property of entities created with WordLift as these links point to RDF resources. As a matter of fact DBpedia, to interlink with Freebase, still uses these type of links rather than just the `machine id`.
:::

## Can I prevent the analysis to run?

Yes. You can switch WordLift's analysis ON and OFF by clicking on the *open|close* arrow on the top right corner of the WordLift's Edit widget. See the *.gif* below:

![image](./images/wl_toggle_3-13-3.gif)

What factors determine Wordlift's rating of an entity?

## Can I prevent WordLift from loading Wikimedia images?

Yes. You can prevent WordLift from loading images that come from Wikipedia. In your `wp-config.php`, add the following line:
`define( 'WL_EXCLUDE_IMAGES_REGEX', 'https?://[^.]*\.wikimedia\.org/.*' );`

**before** the line

`/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */`

## I have already published a JSON-LD on the page. How can I integrate it with the JSON-LD that WordLift creates?

We provide several options to help you integrate WordLift with the existing markup:

1. Completely disable WordLift’s JSON-LD by adding `add_filter( 'wl_jsonld_enabled', '__return_false' );` in your theme.
2. Edit WordLift’s JSON-LD by using WordPress filters (this requires PHP development skills), see [here on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52925820/how-do-i-change-the-json-ld-type-from-article-to-newsarticle-in-wordlift).
3. Use [WordLift’s Mappings](https://wordlift.io/academy-entries/wordlift-mappings-tutorial/) to customize the JSON-LD using the UI provided by the plugin in *Dashboard > WordLift > Mappings*
4. Augment WordLift’s JSON-LD by adding your own custom JSON-LD matching the same @id (in this case Google will merge the data from WordLift’s JSON-LD and your JSON-LD)

## What factors determine Wordlift's rating of an entity?

The entity rating in WordLift takes under account the following factors:

- Every entity should be linked to one or more related posts.
- Every entity should have its own description.
- Every entity should link to other entities - when we select other entities to enrich the description of an entity we create relationships in the site's [knowledge graph](/pages/key-concepts##knowledge-graph).
- Entities, just like any post in WordPress, can be kept as draft. Only when we publish them they become available in the analysis and we can use them to classify our contents.
- Entities shall have a featured image. When we add a featured image to an entity we’re adding the `schema-org:image` attribute to it.
- Every entity (unless we’re creating something completely new) should be interlinked with the same entity contained in at least one other dataset. This is called data interlinking and can be done by adding a link to the equivalent entity using the `sameAs` attribute.
- Every entity has a type (i.e. Person, Place, Organization, …) and every type has its own set of properties. When we complete all the properties of an entity we increase the entity visibility and usefulness.

## I have a vocabulary term appearing several times in a page, should I link all of the occurrences to the term, or just once per page?

While on an average length blog post (> 500 words) we shall use a limited number of entities to classify the content, there is not an actual limit for the number of internal links pointing to the same entity page.

In SEO the link juice is transferred equally from every single link: if Google transfers let's say 85% of your article's Page Rank each link will equally get its own share. Five links pointing to the same page will therefore transfer the same amount of link juice of one single link. If I link too many different pages by annotating the blog post with too many entities the link juice will be diluted (and this is why we don't expect to have too many entities per article).

Now we need to consider the following:

- if on the page (including navigation links, footer links and so on) you have too many links already - you easily might hit the [100 link limit](https://moz.com/blog/how-many-links-is-too-many); there is no penalty for that but still it is a good rule to keep the number of links (both internal and external) below the *100-link mark*;
- WordLift is keen on helping you create a good internal linking structure to reduce the bounce rate on your site and to increase the number of pages visited during each browsing session by your readers; if your internal links for the same entity are too many they simply become irrelevant. On the contrary if your article is long enough it is probably good to have 2-3 links pointing to the same entity page (as a reader I might miss the first one and might instead find useful the second or third one).

## When should I link one entity to another?

By running the analysis on the property description text of an entity you can *link* it to other entities. WordLift will store these relationships between one entity and other entities in the [graph](/pages/key-concepts##knowledge-graph) using the Dublin Core property `dct:related`. This information will be used to suggest new connections between the contents of your site. Creating links among relevant entities will create more structure for your content, even though it is not mandatory to do so. You should always link entities that can help other users discover relevant contents (i.e. the entity *\[Berners-Lee\]* shall be linked to entity *\[Web\]* as the two concepts are strictly related.)

## How can I enable or disable links to entities?

You can enable or disable the link to an entity by toggling the "Link" option for each annotation. See below

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-link.gif)

You can also enable or disable links site-wide from the WordLift Settings screen in the General tab as shown below.

![image](./images/wordlift-settings-menu-link.png)

## Why do I get 404 error on pages linked by WordLift?

WordPress is a powerful CMS. Nevertheless, in some cases, posts or pages newly created might return a *scary* **404 Error**. Pages created with WordLift are not an exception and you might end up in a situation where WordLift is creating links to pages that *apparently* do not exist. Don't worry this is a well-known WordPress issue and it can be easily fixed. Head into the dashboard of your website, click *Settings* » *Permalinks* and than press the *Save Changes* button. WordPress will re-generate all the permalinks and the error will be fixed.

![image](./images/wordlift-updatepermalinks.png)

Read [this article](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-fix-wordpress-posts-returning-404-error/) to learn more about this issue from the WPbeginner website.

## What are the datasets WordLift uses for named entity recognition?

WordLift by default uses DBpedia and Freebase to detect and link named entities. With a custom configuration, the content analysis services provided by [Redlink](http://www.redlink.co) and available via our professional services, can use any RDF-based [graph](/pages/key-concepts##knowledge-graph). It is also possible to use *multiple graphs* for named entity recognition and [dereferencing](/pages/key-concepts##dereferencing-http-uris).

## How can I prevent WordLift from creating new entity pages?

The best soution is to convert existing posts, pages and taxonomy terms to entities that will become part of your Knowledge Graph. This way you’ll not create new pages but re-link the existing pages on your web site.

## What is a triple?

A triple is a set of three elements: a subject, a predicate, and an object. Triples are linked together to form a [graph](/pages/key-concepts##knowledge-graph) that is without hierarchy, is machine readable, and can be used to infer new facts. Triples in WordLift describe facts as metadata about an article or an entity.

## Are there any integrations with Neo4j?

Neo4j is a graph database. WordLift stores data in a Linked Data store ([Apache Marmotta](https://marmotta.apache.org)) which provides linked data and SPARQL end-points. As long as Neo4j provides connectors for those interfaces, then an integration is possible.

## Do I need to be Administrator to configure it?

Yes. To configure WordLift you will need to have admin privileges.

## Which Schema Types does WordLift support?

WordLift, using the [Business plan](https://wordlift.io/pricing/), **supports all the schema types** listed in the [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary.

## What is the advantage of using a custom domain for publishing the knowledge graph?

WordLift, includes with the [Business plan](https://wordlift.io/pricing/), the option **to support a custom domain** for linked data publishing.
This means that you can use your own domain name to host the knowledge graph that WordLift creates. The main advantage is that you can use the same domain name for your website (ie `https://www.example.org`) and for the knowledge graph (`https://data.example.org`).
Moreover if you decide to host the knowledge graph on a different platform you are free to do so without any vendor lock-in.
WordLift hosts your data in a [Linked Data platform](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/), using the custom domain you are free to migrate your data to any other compatible graph platform without the need of changing the URIs of your entities.

## How can I change the JSON-LD *@type* from *Article* to *NewsArticle* in WordLift?

WordLift, allows you to filter the the JSON-LD output before it is sent to the client and change any part of it, e.g. in this specific case::

```
add_filter( 'wl_post_jsonld',  function( $jsonld ) {

// Bail out if `@type` isn't set or isn't `Article`.
if ( ! isset( $jsonld['@type'] ) || 'Article' !== $jsonld['@type'] ) {
        return $jsonld;
}

$jsonld['@type'] = 'NewsArticle';

return $jsonld;
} );
```

# Export & Import of the Vocabulary

There are several cases where a user decides to export or import the vocabulary of terms created with **WordLift**. Let’s see them in details:

1. The site needs to be migrated from one server to another,
2. The content structure of a website created for a language can be replicated for another language (and the website is not using a multilingual plugin such as [WPML](https://wpml.org/)),
3. The [vocabulary](/pages/key-concepts#vocabulary) on one site can be re-used for tagging another website running a separate **WordLift** key.

WordPress natively provides both [Export](https://codex.wordpress.org/Tools_Export_Screen) and [Import](https://codex.wordpress.org/Tools_Import_Screen) functionalities. This functionalities have been enhanced for any **WordLift**’s user to ensure that also entities can be moved back and forth across multiple websites.

## How to Export the **WordLift** Vocabulary

To export the vocabulary from the *origin website* go in the WordPress menù under Tools and click the Export link. Choose to export the vocabulary only (unless you need to export the entire website).

## How to Import the **WordLift** Vocabulary

To import the vocabulary in the *destination website* go in the WordPress menù under Tools and click the Import link. Choose the XML file that was produced with the Export function and remember to choose *Import WordPress* and to check the option *Download and import file attachments* to get all entities imported.

:::info Note
When data is imported from a website in one language (let's say English) - the data is saved using the language being set under the **WordLift**'s configuration tab of the destination website.
:::

:::caution Warning
For the images there is currently a limitation in WordPress that might prevent the right images to be imported. More information are available on the [wptips website](http://wptips.me/how-to-import-images-when-importing-posts-from-a-wordpress-export-file/).
:::

## Connecting source and destination websites with *sameAs* links

When importing the vocabulary on a website with a different URL (this would be case 2 or 3 from the scenarios listed above) **WordLift** automatically populates all *sameAs* links with the equivalent entity on the *origin website*.

### Entity interlinking and why is so important

This process is called *entity interlinking* (or [entity reconciliation](/pages/key-concepts#reconciliation)) and it is beneficial for the metadata being published as it provides further means of data reuse.

Let’s say a developer is writing an application to display events and that these events are created with **WordLift** in two different website (one website for English and the other one for German) - the application will be able to use the *sameAs* links to retrive the content in the required language: English if let’s say the users are in the UK and German if the users are from Germany. The otherwise separate datasets will be effectively combined.

:::info Note
When importing the vocabulary on a website with the same URL (this would be case 1) the *sameAs* links are not added by the importer.
:::

## Vocabulary sharing and how to keep it in sync

:::caution Warning
When sharing the same vocabulary on multiple websites the risk of duplicating the content is high and, as a general rule, this shall be prevented.
:::

When the vocabulary grows on one site and we need to re-use it in another site the Export & Import functions might not be the best approach and a different solution can be used (see below).

### Sharing terms among different websites

**WordLift** allows the user to configure the NLP so that it will use multiple datasets for *content analysis* and [entity reconciliation](/pages/key-concepts#reconciliation). An enterprise, for instance, could chose to have a product website that uses, besides the terms created within its internal vocabulary, all the terms created in the vocabulary of the corporate website. This way when an entity is created on the corporate website for describing a new team member, this entity is immediately made available on the product website.

Moreover **WordLift** automatically performs the [entity reconciliation](/pages/key-concepts#reconciliation) without asking the editor any further action (the entity on the product website will have the *sameAs* links pointing to the entity’s URL on the corporate website). In this way all the terms created on one site can be used for annotating content on another websites. When constructing the product website the developer might also chose to redirect the traffic to the entity pages on the source site by using the *sameAs* links (this will avoid content duplication and will increase the interlinking between the different websites).

# Installation

:::info Note
We **suggest** our users to make a full back-up of their website data before installing WordLift.
:::

## Requirements

WordLift is currently available on [WordPress] 4.4 and later.

## Installation

You can install **WordLift** from the [WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordlift/) or manually by uploading the files to your server.

### Automatic Installation

Automatic installation is the easiest way to install WordLift. WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WordLift, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WordLift” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the description, the features, and user reviews. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

### Manual Installation

The manual installation method involves *downloading our plugin* and *uploading it to your webserver* using your favourite FTP application.

Download the provided zip file to the `wp-content/plugins` directory of your [WordPress] installation. Unzip the file,

from the command line:

```
unzip wordlift.zip
```

More information on the manual installation are available on the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) website.

## Activation

To activate the plugin you need a [WordLift key](/pages/key-concepts#wordlift-key). You receive this key after [purchasing a subscription plan](https://wordlift.io/pricing/) the [WordLift] website. An automatic email will be then sent to you containing your key and account information.

You can use the setup Wizard upon startup to activate your subscription.

![image](./images/wordlift-setup-wizard.gif)

When doing so you are able to configure the [key](/pages/key-concepts#wordlift-key), the entity base path (the URL pattern of the WordLift internal vocabulary), the languange used on the website and the publisher of the website.

Alternatively, from the WordPress administration menu, click on *Plugins* / *Installed Plugins*. Then click on *Settings* on the
WordLift plugin.

## Configuration

The *Settings* are also accessible by hovering on the WordLift logo on the WordPress dashboard menu; from there a menu will open.
Click on *Settings* to open the settings screen:

![image](./images/wordlift-settings-screen.png)

From *Settings* screen, as from the Wizard, you can configure:

WordLift Key

The [WordLift Key](/pages/key-concepts#wordlift-key), required to activate the plug-in that can be purchased from the [website](https://wordlift.io/pricing/).

Entity Base Path

When selecting or creating new entities with WordLift, you are actively building your internal vocabulary, adding pages to  your website. When you first built your website, you chose a pattern for the url of the pages you were going to add, such as www.domain.com/name-of-the-page or www.domain.com/seo-keyword/name-of-the-page.
  The same applies with all the pages created with WordLift inside your vocabulary.
  By default WordLift will add the word “vocabulary” between your root domain and the name of the page: www.domain.com/vocabulary/name-of-the-entity-page.
  You can delete the word vocabulary if you want the new entity page to be inside your root domain folder: www.domain.com/name-of-the-entity-page.
  Or you can replace vocabulary with another keyword (or keywords) of your choice, for SEO or branding reason: www.domain.com/seo-keyword/name-of-the-entity-page.

Site Language

The main language used on your website. This is the language that will be used by WordLift when creating the editorial metadata of your content. Be aware, each key should be used for one language only.

Publisher

The person or the organization publishing the content of the website. This is also an entity that can be created directly from this setting screen. This information is used to enrich the metadata on your website.

:::info Note
For more information on the multilingual support of WordLift [read here](/pages/faq#what-are-the-languages-supported-by-wordlift).
:::

You can now continue to the [Key Concepts](/pages/key-concepts) page or head directly to the [Analysis](/pages/analysis).

// File: pages/jsonld

# JSON-LD

The plugin generates JSON-LD markup to improve the visibility of web pages in search engine results pages (SERPs). It uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to identify important concepts within the content and map them to relevant schema.org entities, creating a semantically rich representation of the page. This structured data provides search engines with more information about the content of the page, leading to better rankings and a richer search experience for users.

## Post linked with term
If the post has a single term assigned to it, it will be added to mentions if your post has schema.org type
set to CreativeWork or a subtype of CreativeWork, you can find the full list [here](https://schema.org/CreativeWork#subtypes).

```json

## Post linked with Entity via annotation
If you have an entity linked by annotating the content, it will be added to `mentions` or `about` property
depending on if the title of the entity matches the part of (or) the complete post title.

# Key Concepts

Here is the terminology describing the core concepts that will help you set up and manage your content with WordLift:

## Entity

An **entity** (or thing) is something that exists in the real-world: celebrities, cities, sport teams, buildings, geographical features, movies, celestial objects and works of art are all entities. For a long time, more than four decades, we've been teaching computers to recognise things by simply matching keywords.

Now computers, just like humans do, understand that a text like *\[Thubten Gyatso\]* is not just made of two words but, it has a much richer meaning. *\[Thubten Gyatso\]* is a person, more specifically he's the 13th Dalai Lama who was born in the Tsang-Ü province in Tibet on the 12th of February 1876.

All this information - collectively shared in public sources like Wikipedia and Freebase - is organised in intelligent models known as **Graphs** that are helping computers think the way we do and helping us find this information more quickly and even compute it (i.e. providing answers to question like *"Was Trinley Gyatso his predecessor?"*).

### Entity Types

Web pages are about many different kind of "things". WordLift uses the [Schema.org](http://schema.org) vocabulary to describe a variety of entity types, each of which has its own set of properties that can be used to describe the entity. The broadest item type is **Thing**, which has four properties: *name*, *description*, *url*, and *image*. WordLift supports all the entity types of the schema vocabulary.

### Related Entities

In WordLift **related entities** are primarily the entities being used for annotating a blog post or a page.
Each entity we curate can be eventually *linked* to other entities by running the analysis on its description text.
Entities being *linked* with other entities with the analysis are also known as **related entities**.

## Vocabulary

A **vocabulary** is a collection of things (or entities).

With WordLift, users can create their own custom vocabulary by creating entities and describing their properties (i.e. *\[Europe Day\]* is held on 9 May and celebrates peace and unity in Europe). These entities might already exist in publicly available sources like Wikipedia and Freebase. In this case WordLift provides a list of suggested entities that can be *linked* to (or reconciled with).

When linking entities to each other, WordLift uses the `owl:sameAs` property; this means that we're talking about the same *thing* (or simply that both entities share the same "identity"): "Yes, I'm talking about that same *\[Europe Day\]* that Freebase describes with machine id **m/04f6ymq**".

This linking process is also called [reconciliation] or disambiguation. Find out more on [how to import and export the user vocabulary](/pages/import-export-vocabulary).

## Knowledge Graph

A **knowledge graph** is a network of all kind of entities that are relevant to a specific domain or to an organization.
They are not limited to abstract concepts and relations (as with a vocabulary) but also contain the instances of the things they describe.

Using WordLift as new entities are added in the vocabulary, properties for these entities are populated using the
*ease-to-use* WordPress editing interfaces and new posts are enriched with these entities a knowledge graph is
created and published as [RDF](#rdf) graph in the cloud.

## RDF

**RDF** stands for Resource Description Framework.

RDF is a W3C standard language for representing information.

## Linked Open Data

**Linked Open Data** is [Linked Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) that is made available as **open content**.
Large linked open datasets (or [Knowledge Graph](#knowledge-graph)) include DBpedia and Freebase.

## Reconciliation

**Reconciling** entities we store in our own [vocabulary](#vocabulary) with entities available elsewhere provides computers with an unambiguous way to identify the things we're talking about.

*\[Apple\]* in a specific article might refer to a rather typical British psychedelic-pop band rather than to a World famous computer company or the forbidden fruit. This becomes important when third party applications like search engines need to provide valuable content for users searching for articles on *\[Apple\]* the psychedelic-pop band and not the other two *Apples*.

[Reconciling](#reconciliation) entities means providing computers with unambiguous identifications of the *entities* we talk about.

## Semantic Fingerprint

The result of semantic annotation of a text is a *unique linked identifier* added to the HTML code. This identifier is known as **semantic fingerprint**.

Annotating contents, also known as *semantic enrichment* or *lifting*, creates metadata that computers can understand.
Just like in forensic science human fingerprints are used to identify humans appearing on a crime scene, in computer science we use semantic fingerprints to tell computers what [entities](#entity) we're referring to.

WordLift re-uses these semantic fingerprints for adding Schema.org markup and for re-purposing contents using [Widgets](#widget).

## Dereferencing HTTP URIs

**URI Dereferencing** is the process of looking up a URI on the Web in order to get information about the referenced resource. WordLift uses dereferencing to obtain a snapshot of the properties describing a [named entity](#entity).

## Widget

A **widget** in WordLift is a dynamic visualisation that can be added by the editors to a page via [Shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) or using the WordLift menu.

A Widget is executed by the end-user's browser when accessing a page.
A Widget typically displays informations being stored in the [knowledge graph](#knowledge-graph) and creates dynamic connections between different posts or provides additional information about entities in the post.

## WordLift Edit Post Widget

Contents editors using WordLift can identify the basic '*who*, *what*, *when* and *where*' of an
article and structure information around it by creating new entities in the [custom vocabulary](#vocabulary). These annotations are added to the posts using the **WordLift Edit Post Widget**.

### Top down post annotation

The content editor, from the list of entities being detected in the text, uses these entities to describe his/her post without selecting any specific text annotations.
Entities being selected, in this case, describe the entire post (and not the single occurrence of the entity in the text).

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-post-widget-01.png)

### Bottom up entity annotation

The content editor has choosen the “Expo 2015” occurence in the text. In this case, this specific occurrence, is annotated with the entity "Expo 2015".

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-post-widget-02.png)

### Edit Entity Properties

The content editor is editing the main properties for the entity "Expo 2015" while writing the post.
The complete list of properties can be edited from the [Edit Entity](/pages/edit-entity) page.

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-post-widget-03.png)

### Image Suggestor

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-post-widget-04.png)

Images for each entity appear in the WordLift Edit Post Widget and can be dragged and dropped in the visual editor.

## WordLift key

The **WordLift key** is a *unique value* that is assigned to each user after he/she has subscribed to the WordLift service.

You can now continue to the [Analysis](/pages/analysis) page.

# Mappings

Mappings are designed to help us organize and structure content while improving the SEO on our website.

**The markup in schema.org adds meaning to your content** for search engines but the real benefits come when you **use structured data as the basis for your content model.**

We call it the **entity-based content model** and you can learn more about by watching the following webinars:

- [Content Modeling for Search Optimization with Cruce Saunders](https://wordlift.io/academy-entries/content-modeling/)
- [Get Started with Structured Content and Schema.org](https://wordlift.io/academy-entries/structure-your-content/)

Or by [booking a call with our SEO experts.](https://wordlift.io/book-a-demo).

WordLift mappings have been developed as an integration for the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) plugin and allows you to either:

- re-use fields that you might have already configured with ACF on your CMS or,
- create new fields based on the schema.org taxonomy

## Supported Schema types

WordLift **loads automatically the latest version of the schema.org vocabulary**, supports **all the available schema types**, and allows you to personalize your content model easily while taking care of the injection of the json-ld on your pages.

## Advanced Schema types

### HowTo

HowTo Schema allows you to explain exact instructions to achieving a wanted result by performing a sequence of steps. This can range from guides explaining "How to start your own business" or simple DIY recipes.

### Recipe

A recipe schema allows you to specify steps in your recipe, varying from nutritional information to the method of cooking. This can all be done by choosing specific keywords under the properties. Learn [how to add schema markup for recipes](https://wordlift.io/academy-entries/schema-markup-for-recipe/).

### Course

Course schema markup is the specific entity type for web pages that describe an educational course that may be offered online or in person by public and private schools, colleges, and universities. Learn [how to add course schema markup to your content](https://wordlift.io/academy-entries/course-schema-markup/).

### FAQ

FAQ stands for "Frequently Asked Questions", where the questions that most people ask you about your activities can be listed on this webpage. Some properties include breadcrumbs and lastreviewed, which is the date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness.
Learn more on [how to use the FAQPage Schema type](https://wordlift.io/academy-entries/how-to-use-faq-schema-type/).

### Review

Review schema shows you the opinions and feedback regarding an item, a movie or a service.

### Product

Product markup communicates to Google a series of essential data for your customers such as product description, image, price, availability, conditions, and user ratings.
With WordLift you can create a [product knowledge graph](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/product-knowledge-graph/) and help Google discover more about the brand, the color, the condition (new, used, reconditioned etc) the shipping details and a lot more.
If you are using WooCommerce here is [all you need to know about the product schema](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/schema-markup-woocommerce/).

## Who is using enriched metadata in the form of linked data today?

In the media industries companies like BBC, The Financial Times and Associated Press are investing in these technologies.
In the Public Health Care the World Health Organisation, in the energy sector companies like Enel.
Public libraries are adopting these  standards to share content at regional, national and international level.
Public administrations around the world are committed to make their data available as [Linked Open Data](/pages/key-concepts#linked-open-data).
Search engines like Google, Yahoo!, Bing and Yandex, as well as social networks like Facebook, use these technologies to increase the quality of their services and to become *more meaningful* to their end users.

## Why shall I publish my contents in the form of metadata?

Organising web content around **concepts** or **entities** rather than traditional web pages improves
*navigation*, *content re-use*, *content re-purposing* and *search engine rankings*, bringing the user experience to a new level of engagement.

As your content metadata is published as [Linked Open Data](/pages/key-concepts#linked-open-data) it becomes easier
for third party applications providers like Google to better understand and interact with your content, creating new entry points and  increasing traffic on your website (more on [Schema.org Actions](http://searchengineland.com/schema-user-actions-now-available-189421) from the Search Engine Land website).

## Can you tell me more about WordLift’s SEO benefits?

WordLift allows you to add a layer of metadata to your content, which provides several SEO benefits:

Schema markup added to all your content will ensure Google will properly index and unquestionably understand the content of your article;
Internal linking based on semantic concepts more than anchor texts will increase the SEO value of your pages;
A properly curated vocabulary will act as search magnet on higher traffic queries to be then connected to your blog posts and your pages;
Connecting your content semantically has a terrific effect on engagement metrics as well and good engagement metrics are of course an important signal for Google as well. Thanks to the contextual info added to your content and the connections between pages and posts that can be made through the 5 visualization widgets available, you will enjoy double digit growth for all your usability metrics.

You can now continue to the [Getting Started](/wordpress-plugin/getting-started) page.

# Product Knowledge Graph Builder

**Product KG Builder** is the feature for e-commerce that allows you to automate your SEO and [create a product knowledge graph](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/how-build-product-knowledge-graph/) **with your Google Merchant Feed**.

This helps e-commerce to **communicate with Google's Shopping Graph and get free listings in Google Shopping**. At the same time, it **improves the user experience** by providing your customers with information that is relevant to their search.

WordLift Product KG Builder can make a difference in your e-commerce and positively **impact both organic traffic and sales**.

## Get Started

Once you have purchased the WordLift [Business+E-Commerce subscription](https://wordlift.io/business/) you will receive a key and then you will be able to access your dashboard.

The first step to start using your PKG Builder is to go to your dashboard and click on **+ Add Merchant** on the left side, then follow the simple steps in the wizard.

![image](./images/pkg-builder0.png)

### 1. Link your Google Account

Sign in with your Google account.

![image](./images/pkg-builder1.png)

### 2. Choose the Merchant Feed

Select the Merchant Feed you want to import.

![image](./images/pkg-builder2.png)

At the moment, only one language per import is supported, therefore if your feed contains multiple languages, use the *Path* to filter the language, e.g. **/en** . Then you can create another configuration for another language.

### 3. Create your Product Knowledge Graph

Link the website and import the data from the Merchant Feed to the website.
To **create your Product Knowledge Graph** you need to add the script into your website.

![image](./images/pkg-builder3.png)

Click *Finish*. Once you have completed these 3 steps, you will see that the **products** have been imported into the backend of your e-commerce website and **already enriched with structured data**.

From the WordLift dashboard, you can open the backend of your website and see the products imported and you can synchronize the data (it takes about 1 hour).

# Publish

## Publish Entity

When saved, entities are created as `custom posts` in the local WordPress installation and are accessible from the [WordLift vocabulary](/pages/key-concepts#vocabulary).

:::info Note
The URL for an entity page is as follows::

[http://](#)<*name-of-your-wordpress-site*>/?entity=<*name-of-the–entity*>
:::

### Metadata being added to Entity pages

### RDF representation of the Entity

By clicking on the **View Linked Data** button (right after the *Permalink* in the editor) the **RDF representation of the entity** is displayed using [LodView](http://lodview.it/).

![image](./images/wordlift-publish-entity-view-linked-data.png)

![image](./images/wordlift-publish-entity-lodview.png)

In this example you can see the relation being created between the entity *\[Mars\]* and the entity *\[Solar System\]* (`dcterms:relation`). This relation has been created from the [entity page](/pages/edit-entity#linking-other-entities) page by annotating the description of the entity.

![image](./images/wordlift-publish-entity-lodlive.png)

You can also see (in this last image using [LodLive](http://lodlive.it/)) the `sameAs` attributes.

## Publish Post/Page

Posts and Pages with **WordLift** are annotated using the `schema.org` vocabulary.
The *schema markup* is a code (a semantic vocabulary) to help search engines return more informative results for their users.

### Metadata being added to Post/Page

By clicking on the **Test Google Rich Snippets** button (right after the *Permalink* in the editor) you can see the list of entities being added to the content from the **Google Structured Data Testing Tool**.

![image](./images/wordlift-publish-post-test-structured-data.png)

![image](./images/wordlift-publish-structured-data-testing.png)

In this example we're telling search engines that this post could be relevant for searches related to the *\[Solar System\]*.

### RDF representation of the Post/Page

By clicking on the **View Linked Data** button (right after the *Permalink* in the editor) the **RDF representation of the post** is displayed using [LodView](http://lodview.it/).

As of today, the data being represented in RDF for each post or page include:

- schema-org:**datePublished**
- schema-org:**dateModified**
- schema-org:**interactionCount**
- rdfs:**label**
- rdf:**type**
- schema-org:**url**
- dcterms:**references**
- schema-org:**author**

![image](./images/wordlift-publish-post-lodview.png)

:::info Note
In the RDF representation of the posts you can find all entities related to a post (or a page) by looking at the `dcterms:references` attribute

## Rich Snippets

By clicking on the **Test Google Rich Snippets** button (right after the *Permalink* in the editor) you can see the list of entities being added to the content from the **Google Structured Data Testing Tool**.

![image](./images/wordlift-publish-post-test-structured-data.png)

![image](./images/wordlift-publish-structured-data-testing.png)

In this example we're telling search engines that this post could be relevant for searches related to the *\[Solar System\]*.

## Linked Data

By clicking on the **View Linked Data** button (right after the *Permalink* in the editor) the **RDF representation of the entity** is displayed using [LodView](http://lodview.it/).

![image](./images/wordlift-publish-entity-view-linked-data.png)

![image](./images/wordlift-publish-entity-lodview.png)

In this example you can see the relation being created between the entity *\[Mars\]* and the entity *\[Solar System\]* (`dcterms:relation`). This relation has been created from the [entity page](/pages/edit-entity#linking-other-entities) page by annotating the description of the entity.

![image](./images/wordlift-publish-entity-lodlive.png)

You can also see (in this last image using [LodLive](http://lodlive.it/)) the `sameAs` attributes.

As of today, the data being represented in RDF for each post or page include:

- schema-org:**datePublished**
- schema-org:**dateModified**
- schema-org:**interactionCount**
- rdfs:**label**
- rdf:**type**
- schema-org:**url**
- dcterms:**references**
- schema-org:**author**

## Widgets and Shortcodes

### Shortcodes

WordLift provides several useful shortcodes to provide enhanced visualizations on your web site.

### Widgets

WordLift widgets can be inserted in a post or page to give a rich visual presentation of the entities populating the blog. As the blog grows and entities are created and mentioned, the widgets update their content without intervention from the editor.

### Faceted Search

```html
[wl_faceted_search]
```

The Faceted Search widget can be used on entity pages to display and filter the posts related to the current and other entities. It is useful for [content discovery](/pages/discover#the-navigator-widget).

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-faceted-search-widget-frontend.gif)

### Navigator

```html
[wl_navigator]
```

The Navigator widget offers links to **semantic-related posts** in the blog.
The search is made by considering the entities mentioned in the current post and by finding other blog posts that mentions the same entities. It is useful for [content discovery](/pages/discover#the-faceted-search-widget).

![image](./images/wordlift-discover-navigator.png)

Here follows the list of the supported parameters:

title

*(optional)* Title to be displayed above navigator. Defaults to 'Related articles'.

limit

*(optional)* The total number of posts to display. Defaults to 4.

offset

*(optional)* Offset for posts to display. It helps you break the list of recommended articles in different blocks (to add advertising and/or CTAs). Defaults to 0. Defaults to 4.

template_id

*(optional)* The id of the script element which has mustache template. For example if the template is in `<script id="wordlift_navigator_sidebar_template" type="text/mustache">...</script>` then `template_id` would be `wordlift_navigator_sidebar_template`.

post_id

*(optional)* The post ID of a post of which navigator you want to display. Defaults to the current post. This is helpful if you want to display the navigator of post 'A' on post 'B' or add the navigator shortcode for a specific post in a non-post page.

uniqid

*(optional)* The Unique ID for the navigator. This can be used to style or to apply navigator filters that are specific to an instance of the navigator (instead of acting on multiple navigators).

Here is a sample code for personalizing the template to be used as reference:

```html
<script id="wordlift_navigator_sidebar_template" type="text/mustache">
{{#items}}
<div class="related-articles__item">
    <a class="related-articles__img" href="{{post.permalink}}"><img src="{{{post.thumbnail}}}" alt="{{{post.title}}}" title="{{{post.title}}}"></a>
    <div class="related-articles__content">
        <h4 class="related-articles__title"><a href="{{post.permalink}}">{{{post.title}}}</a></h4>
    </div>
</div>
{{/items}}
</script>
```

The filters available for the navigator widget are:

- `wl_navigator_data_post`: Gets each navigator post item, post ID and uniqid. Returns the customized post item.
- `wl_navigator_data_entity`: Gets each entity post item, post ID and uniqid. Returns the customized entity item.
- `wl_navigator_data_placeholder`: Gets the complete result array and uniqid. Returns the customized result array. Can be used to seed navigator with placeholder

### Chord

```html
[wl_chord width=... height=... main_color=... depth=... global=...]

global

*(optional)* When *global=true* the main entity of the chord is not the current post, but the most mentioned entity in the latest posts.

### Geomap

```html
[wl_geomap width=... height=... global=...]

![image](./images/wordlift-discover-vocabulary.gif)

By default the widget takes into account the latest 100 entities from all types (i.e. Person, Place, Organization, ...).
The following paramenters can be used to personalise the entities beind displayed in the vocabulary:

limit

the total number of entities to displaye (*100* is the defualt value). Use `-1` to remove the limit.

type

the type of entities to display (*all* is the default value). Use Person\`to display only entities of type Person.

orderby

the selection is by default related to the alphabetical order (*title* is the default value). Selected entities can be ordered using different parameters. [Read more here](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/WP_Query/parse_query/)

# Sidebar

## Content Analysis and Disambiguation

![image](./images/wordlift-content-analysis-disambiguation-start.png)

Let's choose as relevant entity in this example *\[Web\]*, as the post is referring to the World Wide Web. As the entity type for *\[Web\]* is a `Thing` the entity appears under the *what* category.

:::info Note
[Reconciling](/pages/key-concepts#reconciliation) entities means **linking** the entity appearing in this text with its own equivalent on other sources (i.e. DBpedia or Freebase).
:::

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-post-widget-05.png)

Using the [WordLift Edit Post Widget](/pages/analysis#wordLift-edit-post-widget) you can now read the following parameters:

- **Entity Title** the name of the entity
- **Entity Category** the type of entity according to the `schema.org` vocabulary
- **Entity Description** the description of the entity

All parameters but the Title can be edited directly from the [WordLift Edit Post Widget]

:::info Note
Data being used for the enrichments comes from openely avaialble sources
like DBpedia that might contain misleading information that the editor can alwasy edit.

Entity properties can also be edited clicking on the "open in vocabulary" link (see [Edit Entity](/pages/edit-entity) page.)
:::

Once you hit **Save** you are annotating this post which means adding a [semantic fingerprint](/pages/key-concepts#semantic-fingerprint) to this piece of content.

In this post another important entity worth mentioning is the creator of the World Wide Web Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
The entity is properly identified as `Person` and all `Person` and `Organization` types are available under the *who* category.

![image](./images/wordlift-content-analysis-disambiguation-berners-lee.png)

:::info Note
Annotations are saved when a blog post or a page is published. Annotations and data related to each entity being annotated remain in *draft* untill the post is published.
:::

:::caution Warning
When the text from the Visual Editor is edited or removed all annotations being saved are lost. WordLift stores the editor's selection of entities in the content of the Visual Editor.
:::

## Manual Entity Selection

If you are looking to annotate an entity that hasn’t been suggested by the semantic analysis you still can do it manually.

Here is how it works:

First select the entity that you want to annotate

- Go to WordLift Edit Post Widget.
- Click on Add.
- Choose the entities that you want to annotate form the suggested list.

![image](./images/manual-entity-selection.gif)

## Adding Entities

The purpose of using WordLift is to (1) categorize your content, (2) help people find content of interest to them, and (3) help WordLift describe your contents in *machine-readable* format so that other computers can re-use it.

In some cases key concepts that are important for (1), (2) and (3) are not automatically detected by WordLift and need to be taught by creating new entities.

:::info Note
A basic guideline for adding entity is: people should apply entities the same way a librarian would plausibly use tags to classify the content you're writing if it was a book. For some basic guidelines on when creating new entities [read here](/pages/faq#what-are-the-guidelines-for-creating-new-entities-to-annotate-a-blog-post-or-a-page).
:::

New entities being added will become part of the [WordLift vocabulary](/pages/key-concepts#vocabulary).

Once an entity as been added to the vocabulary it will be automatically detected every-time you mention it again in your contents.

In our example one significant entity has not been detected and it is worth *teaching* it to WordLift.

![image](./images/wordlift-content-analysis-new-entity-highlight.gif)

The entity is *\[WordLift\]* itself. To create a new entity simply highlight the text `WordLift`, then click the button **Create New Entity** at the top of the [WordLift Edit Post Widget] and by clicking it you will be then able to edit the properties of the new entity.

![image](./images/wordlift-content-analysis-new-entity-creation.png)

Choose the category *Creative Work* (it also applies to *Software*), add a description and hit the "Save" button. Now the new entity will appear as [related entities](/pages/key-concepts#related-entities)  of the blog post along with *\[Web\]* and *\[Tim Berners-Lee\]*.

![image](./images/wordlift-content-analysis-new-entity-creation2.png)

:::caution Warning
When creating a new entity over **an existing annotation**: a) remove the annotated entity, b) re-write the entity and c) create a new one (as described above). See animation below.
:::

![image](./images/wl-new-entity-specific-case.gif)

## Updating and Linking Entities

### Updating the description

When we have something meaningful to say on a specific concept **we shall curate the information and edit the data that has been fetched automatically by WordLift** (*this will create our own version of Wikipedia*).

### Linking other entities

Entity pages can be annotated just like you would do with a blog posts.

After saving the new description you wrote, WordLift will analyze the text and suggest related entities. You can now *link* an entity with other entities. WordLift will store these relationships between one entity and other entities in the [graph](/pages/key-concepts#knowledge-graph) using the Dublin Core property `dct:related`. This information will be used to infer new connections between the contents of the site. For more information on *entity linking* [read the faq](/pages/faq#when-should-i-link-one-entity-to-another).

% Entities being *linked* are listed as **Releated Entities** in the editing screen of the entity.
%
% .. image:: /images/wordlift-content-analysis-new-entity-related-entity.png

## Synonyms

You can add synonyms in WordLift for any entity. Synonyms are marked up in the structured data using the schema property [alternateName](https://schema.org/alternateName)
. WordLift will automatically add the synonyms it knows for a given entity. WordLift also uses synonyms for its content analysis: if you want an entity to be detected in the future you shall add all the available synonyms (ie. “WWW” is a synonym for “World Wide Web” - capitalization will be ignored so “WWW” is the same as “www).

## Entity Types

Here follows the list of properties that can be edited with WordLift for each entity type.

| Type           | Description                                            | Properties                                                                                                                                                                            | Schema.org      |

# Troubleshooting

In rare cases, you might receive an error message when installing or updating WordLift. Here are some of the issues we gathered from our clients.

## Altervista blocking **WordLift** SaaS APIs

![image](./images/wordlift-troubleshooting-altervista-1.png)

If WordLift is not working as expected, your key cannot be validated and you are using Altervista go to the *Server to Server* configuration in the Settings tab of your WordPress dashboard.

![image](./images/wordlift-troubleshooting-altervista-2.png)

Complete the identification procedure via SMS by adding your phone number.

![image](./images/wordlift-troubleshooting-altervista-3.png)

Now add `*.wordlift.it` in the whitelist (*.it*) and you are all set. WordLift can now interact with the backend APIs, your key gets validated and you are ready to WordLift your website.

______________________________________________________________________

## While running the analysis I am receiving a Bad Request error

Typically this happens when the dataset of your website is corrupted (ie the post URI lacks the domain name).
[Contact the support](mailto:support@wordlift.io) and we will rebuild your dataset.

# Widgets

## Context Cards

[Context Cards](/pages/discover#context-cards) provide an immediate preview of an entity. If the entity has been annotated and, if links are active, WordLift will show a preview of the annotated entity.

By default context cards will show up on hovering if Links to Entity Pages are enabled. To disable context cards, add the following code to your theme:

The context card itself is wrapped within a class `wl-context-card` You can style this class and the child element classes using CSS. Other classes that you can use to style the context cards:

- `wl-context-card__image` - Image element
- `wl-context-card__description` - Wrapper element around complete description
- `wl-context-card__description__logo` - Publisher logo image element
- `wl-context-card__description__text` - Wrapper element around description text

### Advanced Filters to override default behaviour

#### Javascript Filter `wl_context_cards_load_fn_supplier`

This is a function supplier filter that the context card applies if provided. This filter can be used to supply a function that overrides the the default function that returns a fetch (or any other request library) promise.

This filter receives two arguments:

1. Endpoint of the context cards (`url`)
2. DOM element that triggered the context card (`el`)

The filter is expected to return a fetch (or any other request library) promise with the desired request.

Here's a sample implementation of this filter:

```Javascript
const settings = global["_wlEntityRedirectSettings"];

addFilter("wl_context_cards_load_fn_supplier", "wordlift", (defaultFn) => {
    return (url, el) => {
        const enabled = el.getAttribute("data-entity-redirect-enabled");

        // If entity redirect isn't enabled for this target, then return the defaultFn.
        if ("true" !== enabled) return defaultFn(url, el);

        const join = -1 === url.indexOf("?") ? "?" : "&";
        // should load things
        const ids = el
            .getAttribute("data-id")
            .split(";")
            .map((s) => encodeURIComponent(s));

        const params =
            `${join}website=1&entity-redirect=true&id[]=` + ids.join("&id[]=");

        return fetch(`${settings.url}${params}`)
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((json) => {
                // Return the JSON if it contains at least 2 elements (i.e. an entity and the web site).
                if (1 < json.length) return json;

                // Otherwise return the default function.
                return defaultFn(url, el);
            });
    };
});
```

#### PHP Filter `wl_anchor_data_attributes`

This filter lets you add custom data attributes to `<a class="wl-anchor" />` links in the post. This received existing `attributes` and the `post_id`. Here's a sample implementation of this filter:

```PHP
add_filter( 'wl_anchor_data_attributes', function ( $attributes, $post_id ) {

    return $attributes + array(
            'entity-redirect-enabled' =>
                ( Wordlift_Entity_Redirect_Status::is_enabled( $post_id ) ? 'true' : 'false' )
        );
}, 10, 2 );
```

## Faceted Search

**Entity pages** can be used for helping users browse the content of your website. This is done using the **Faceted Search Widget**.
The Widget can be added on the entity page using the **Faceted Search** option from the [Widgets Dropodown Menu](/pages/analysis#wordlift-widgets-menu)

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-faceted-search-widget.png)

Alternatively, the `[wl_faceted_search]` shortcode can be used.

- **Faceted Search**
  : Provides a faceted search user interface to help readers discover relevant articles using the network of entities.

![image](./images/wordlift-edit-entity-faceted-search-widget-frontend.gif)

The example above represents the widget displayed in the front-end. The reader can select multiple concepts and highlight the list of articles related to these concepts.

## Navigator

The [Navigator widget](/pages/discover#the-navigator-widget) by default is wrapped in a `wl-navigator` class. You can style this class and the child element classes using CSS.

Optionally, while using the navigator, you can also specify a `template_id` to style a specific instance with its own template.
The template can be written using [Mustache](https://github.com/Mustache/Mustache): a framework-agnostic way to style web components.

Here's a sample code that you can use as reference:

```html
<script id="wordlift_navigator_sidebar_template" type="text/mustache">
{{#items}}
<div class="related-articles__item">
<a class="related-articles__img" href="{{post.permalink}}"><img src="{{{post.thumbnail}}}" alt="{{{post.title}}}" title="{{{post.title}}}"></a>
<div class="related-articles__content">
    <h4 class="related-articles__title"><a href="{{post.permalink}}">{{{post.title}}}</a></h4>
</div>
</div>
{{/items}}
</script>
```

As a theme developer you have complete flexibility on both: the contents of these templates and the CSS styling.
Read here the [parameters supported](/pages/shortcodes#navigator-widget) by the Navigator widget.

# WordLift Theme Development

## Who should read this

This document is intended for Web Developers that would like to extend their themes to support WordLift's data model and features.

In the first paragraph we describe the WordLift data model, i.e. *how additional properties for entities are stored in WordPress*.

## WordLift Data Model

1. WordLift Entities are **custom posts**;
2. Entity properties are managed as standard posts' metadata;
3. Entity types are managed through a [custom taxonomy](https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies#Custom_Taxonomies);
4. **When a property references another entity:**
     - Its value is the entity ID (if the entity is inside the same WordPress site),
     - Its value is the entity URI (if the entity is outside the WordPress site).
5. The 4Ws classification, i.e. the relationships among posts and entities, are stored in a custom table called *wl_relation_instances*.
6. WordLift's Topics are a [custom taxonomy](https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies#Custom_Taxonomies)

## Content Filtering - Available APIs

1. Standard WordPress methods (such as [get_posts](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts) and [get_post_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post_meta/)) can be used on entities;
2. [get_post_terms](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_post_terms) can be used to extract topics from posts see the example below;

```php
wp_get_post_terms( <post_id>, Wordlift_Topic_Taxonomy_Service::TAXONOMY_NAME, <args> )
```

3. WordLift's *Properties API* can be used to read/write entity properties using schema.org property names. See [here](https://github.com/insideout10/wordlift-plugin/blob/master/src/modules/core/wordlift_core_schema_api.php);
4. WordLift's *Relations API* can be used to access 4W relationships. See [here](https://github.com/insideout10/wordlift-plugin/blob/master/src/modules/core/wordlift_core_post_entity_relations.php).

## Personalization of Entity pages - Single Post

Entities are configured in WordPress as [Custom Post Types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Post_Types) and the post type is called **entity**.

To personalise the design of entity pages the template file to be used is called [Single Post](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/#single-post).

Template files in WordPress are modular, reusable files, to create web pages on your web site. To learn more how to customize an existing WordPress theme or create a new one read the [template hirarchy page](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/) on the WordPress website or visualise the [WordPress template hierarchy](https://wphierarchy.com/).

:::info Note
When [articles or pages are turned into entities](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wordlift-3-15/) they mantain their existing post type.
:::

To personalise the template based on the entity type use the following:

```php
Wordlift_Entity_Type_Service::get_instance()->get( $post_id )
```

This will return:

```php
    * @return array|null {
* An array of type properties or null if no term is associated
*
* @type string css_class     The css class, e.g. `wl-thing`.
* @type string uri           The schema.org class URI, e.g. `http://schema.org/Thing`.
* @type array  same_as       An array of same as attributes.
* @type array  custom_fields An array of custom fields.
* @type array  linked_data   An array of {@link Wordlift_Sparql_Tuple_Rendition}.
* }
```

## Personalization of the Navigator Widget

The [Navigator widget](/pages/discover#the-navigator-widget) by default is wrapped in a `wl-navigator` class. You can style this class and the child element classes using CSS.

Optionally, while using the navigator, you can also specify a `template_id` to style a specific instance with its own template.
The template can be written using [Mustache](https://github.com/Mustache/Mustache): a framework-agnostic way to style web components.

Here's a sample code that you can use as reference:

```html
<script id="wordlift_navigator_sidebar_template" type="text/mustache">
{{#items}}
<div class="related-articles__item">
<a class="related-articles__img" href="{{post.permalink}}"><img src="{{{post.thumbnail}}}" alt="{{{post.title}}}" title="{{{post.title}}}"></a>
<div class="related-articles__content">
    <h4 class="related-articles__title"><a href="{{post.permalink}}">{{{post.title}}}</a></h4>
</div>
</div>
{{/items}}
</script>
```

        const enabled = el.getAttribute("data-entity-redirect-enabled");

        // If entity redirect isn't enabled for this target, then return the defaultFn.
        if ("true" !== enabled) return defaultFn(url, el);

        const join = -1 === url.indexOf("?") ? "?" : "&";
        // should load things
        const ids = el
            .getAttribute("data-id")
            .split(";")
            .map((s) => encodeURIComponent(s));

        const params =
            `${join}website=1&entity-redirect=true&id[]=` + ids.join("&id[]=");

        return fetch(`${settings.url}${params}`)
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((json) => {
                // Return the JSON if it contains at least 2 elements (i.e. an entity and the web site).
                if (1 < json.length) return json;

                // Otherwise return the default function.
                return defaultFn(url, el);
            });
    };
});
```

#### PHP Filter `wl_anchor_data_attributes`

This filter lets you add custom data attributes to `<a class="wl-anchor" />` links in the post. This received existing `attributes` and the `post_id`. Here's a sample implementation of this filter:

```PHP
add_filter( 'wl_anchor_data_attributes', function ( $attributes, $post_id ) {

                ( Wordlift_Entity_Redirect_Status::is_enabled( $post_id ) ? 'true' : 'false' )
        );
}, 10, 2 );

# Product Knowledge Graph Builder

**Product KG Builder** is the feature for e-commerce that allows you to automate your SEO and **[create a Product Knowledge Graph](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/how-build-product-knowledge-graph/) with your Google Merchant Feed.**

This helps e-commerce to **communicate with Google’s Shopping Graph and get free listings in Google Shopping**. At the same time, it **improves the user experience** by providing your customers with information that is relevant to their search.

WordLift [Product Knowledge Graph Builder](https://wordlift.io/seo-for-non-wordpress-ecommerce/) can make a difference in your e-commerce and positively **impact both organic traffic and sales.**

> **Behind the Scenes:**
> Our system automatically parses your Merchant Feed and enriches product data with structured metadata. This seamless integration helps Google understand your products better, resulting in improved search visibility and customer engagement.

## Compatibility Across Platforms

Our Product Knowledge Graph Builder is designed **for e-commerce platforms no WordPress**. It's the perfect solution **for any CMS, including Shopify, Magento, Joomla, and Drupal.** This means no matter what technology powers your e-commerce site, you can easily integrate our tool to enhance your SEO and visibility on Google Shopping. It's simple, straightforward, and ensures no one is left out.

> **Behind the Scenes:**
> The integration layer connects with a variety of e-commerce systems using standardized APIs, ensuring robust and secure data exchange regardless of the platform.

## Get Started

Once you have purchased the WordLift [Business subscription](https://wordlift.io/pricing/) you will receive a key and then you will be able to access your dashboard.

The first step to start using your PKG Builder is to go to your dashboard and click on **+ Add Merchant** on the left side, then follow the simple steps in the wizard.

### Overview Diagram

Here is an overview of the Product Knowledge Graph Builder setup process:

![Product Knowledge Graph Builder Flow](images/PKGBuilder_workflow.svg)

### 1. Link your Google Account

**What You Do:**
Sign in with your Google account by clicking the provided button in the wizard.

![image](images/PKGBuilder_1.png)

> **Behind the Scenes:**
> Our system uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authorization. This ensures that your credentials remain safe while granting the necessary access to import your Merchant Feed data.

### 2. Choose the Merchant Feed

**What You Do:**
Select the Merchant Feed you want to import.

![image](images/PKGBuilder_2.png)

At the moment, only one language per import is supported. Therefore, if your feed contains multiple languages, use the **Path** to filter the language (e.g., **/en**). Then you can create another configuration for another language.

> **Behind the Scenes:**
> The tool validates and maps the feed data to create a consistent structure for your Product Knowledge Graph. Language filters help ensure that the correct version of your content is imported.

### 3. Create your Product Knowledge Graph

**What You Do:**
Link your website and import the data from the Merchant Feed to the website. To **create your Product Knowledge Graph** you need to add the provided script into your website.

Click **Finish**. Once you have completed these 3 steps, you will see that the **products** have been imported into the backend of your e-commerce website and **already enriched with structured data.**

From the WordLift dashboard, you can open the backend of your website to view the imported products and synchronize the data (this process takes about 1 hour).

> **Behind the Scenes:**
> When you add the script to your website, it initiates a secure connection between your site and our servers. Data is then synchronized using batch updates and caching techniques to ensure efficient processing.

### Last Update

The update of [Product Knowledge Graph Builder](https://wordlift.io/seo-for-non-wordpress-ecommerce/) added important elements to this feature:

- You can **reassign an existing merchant feed configuration to another Google account** that is not the same as the originally configured account. This way you have control over your data even if the platform was configured by someone else.
- In the PKG Builder configuration, you can **add a custom domain** and specify the dataset you want to use.
- You can check the **inport synchronization** at any time.
- **Change the "Seller Name."** This element, which cannot be edited in the Merchant Feed, is customizable in our Builder.

> **Behind the Scenes:**
> These new features allow for greater flexibility and control. The modular design of our system ensures that updates and customizations are applied seamlessly without disrupting the overall data flow.

### Advanced Integration

For developers looking to customize their product data processing, we offer a powerful [webhooks integration](./webhooks.md). This allows you to modify RDF data from the Merchant Center before it's committed to the Graph store, enabling advanced customization of your Product Knowledge Graph.

## IMPORTANT

To ensure the proper implementation of structured data and Knowledge Graph, **it is crucial to effectively manage canonical links for products within the Google Merchant Center**. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how to accomplish this task, we highly recommend referring to Google's official documentation available at the [following link.](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9340054?hl=en)

# Webhooks

> **What is a webhook?** A webhook is a method used to send real-time data updates from one application to another as soon as an event occurs. It allows for seamless integration and communication between systems by automatically triggering a callback when specific events take place.


## Introduction

This guide explains the new webhooks feature in the Product Knowledge Graph Builder. With webhooks, your platform can modify RDF data from the Merchant Center before it’s committed to the Graph store. This enables greater customization of product graphs, enhancing SEO and ensuring that your product information is as accurate and enriched as possible.

---

## How It Works

The integration process works in the following sequence:

1. **Retrieve Product from Google Merchant Center:**
   The Platform KG Builder queries the Merchant Center to retrieve product data.

2. **Product Graph Creation:**
   A product graph is generated for each product based on the imported Merchant Feed data.

3. **Webhook Invocation:**
   The Platform KG Builder sends product graphs in batches to your webhook endpoint via an HTTP POST request. The webhook is expected to process (e.g., enhance, validate, or modify) the RDF data.

4. **Response Processing:**
   Your webhook replies with the updated RDF graph. The Platform KG Builder then writes this updated data to the Graph store.

## Technical Details

### Endpoint Details

- **HTTP Method:** POST
- **Endpoint Example:**
  `https://example.org/webhook/calls`

### Request Headers

- `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`

### Request Payload Structure

The payload is a JSON object that includes:
- **webhook_name:** Identifier for the event (e.g., `"productkg_preupdate"`).
- **items:** An array of product objects where each product has:
  - **id:** Unique identifier (typically a URL).
  - **rdf:** An object containing:
    - **format:** RDF format (e.g., `"turtle"`).
    - **data:** The actual RDF data in a string format.

### Example Request (Step-by-Step)

1. **Prepare the CURL Command:**

   ```bash
   curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/webhook/calls" \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
        -d '{
     "webhook_name": "before_productkg_create",
     "items": [
       {
         "id": "https://data.example.org/test-841554094878123/01/7895653316409",
         "rdf": {
           "format": "turtle",
           "data": "<https://data.example.org/test-841554094878123/01/7895653316409/size-0>..."
         }
       }
     ]
   }'
   ```

2. **Send the Request:**
   Run the above CURL command in your terminal. This POST request sends the product graphs to your webhook endpoint for processing.

### Example Response

Your webhook should respond with an HTTP 200 status and a JSON payload that contains the updated RDF data. For example:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 8998
connection: close

{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "https://data.example.org/test-841554094878123/01/7895653316409",
      "rdf": {
        "format": "turtle",
        "data": "<https://data.example.org/test-841554094878123/01/7895653316409/size-0>..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

*Note:* The response must include the updated RDF data exactly as processed by your webhook.

---

## Step-by-Step Example Walkthrough

1. **Graph Creation:**
   The Platform KG Builder retrieves product data and creates RDF graphs for each product.

2. **Webhook Call:**
   Each graph is sent via an HTTP POST request to your webhook endpoint. Use the CURL command provided above to simulate a call.

3. **Webhook Processing:**
   Your webhook receives the JSON payload, processes the RDF data (for example, altering specific fields or adding new metadata), and returns the updated graph.

4. **Data Synchronization:**
   Upon receiving the HTTP 200 response with the updated RDF graphs, the Platform KG Builder writes the data to the Graph store.

---

## Conclusion

By following this guide, integrators can easily set up and test the webhook functionality. This feature not only enables real-time manipulation of product graphs but also ensures that your e-commerce platform communicates effectively with Google’s Shopping Graph, boosting both search visibility and customer engagement.

# SEO Add-On for Google Sheets

[**SEO Add-on for Google Sheets™ by WordLift**](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/seo-add-on-for-google-sheets/) is the extension that allows you to perform **semantic keyword research** and **entity analysis**, and create a JSON-LD to help Google understand what your content is about.

With a few simple clicks, you can install the extension, you can analyze the entities behind a search query and the entities behind a web page (whether it’s your page or a competitor’s) and develop a semantic content strategy that determines which entities can enrich your content and beat the competition.

The Entity Analysis supports hundreds of languages with many different alphabets (any language natively supported by WikiData).

In this video you will learn what is SEO Add-On for Google Sheets and how it can help you to improve your SEO strategy.


<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fxb9tugJMe8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## How it works

### 1. Installation

To install the SEO Add-on, open the Google Marketplace by clicking on the following link:

<a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/wordlift/785668802292">https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/wordlift/785668802292</a>

Then click on the *Install* button, then the *Continue* button, and then click on *Allow* when requested.


### 2. Create Google Sheets

Once the SEO Add-on is installed, you can create a new Google Sheets™ document by clicking on this link, [sheets.new](http://sheets.new).

When in Google Sheets, open the SEO Add-on by clicking on the *Extensions* menu, the *WordLift*, and finally *Open*: the sidebar will show.


### 3. Configure Settings

Next step is to configure the **SEO Add-on settings**, click on the Next button in the sidebar.
You'll need a key for the SEO Add-on to work. Normally we prefill the key based on your e-mail address, but if you're using a different e-mail address with Google, you'll need to insert the key yourself.

You can also configure your **target geo market**, **language** and the **Google domain** to use for SERP analysis.


### 4. Run the Entity Analysis 

Start running the Entity analysis is very easy. Once you have set up your SEO add-on, click **Entity Analysis** and follow the steps: Select up to 5 queries or URLs you want to analyze and run the analysis.

The result includes:
- The **list of entities** with links to DBpedia or WiKidata,
- The **confidence level** of each entity (a value from 0 to 1 that takes into account factors such as thematic relevance and contextual ambiguity),
- The **ranking** of the entities in the SERP (this data is obtained during the analysis of the entities to which a query refers),
- The **number of occurrences** in the text (i.e., how often the entity appears in the mentioned content).

You can select the most relevant entities, and the SEO Add-on will automatically create the JSON-LD that you need to copy and past into your website. 


### 5. Expand Your Content

With the **Content Expander**, you can enrich your content by integrating relevant entities. Here's how you can make the most of it in just three simple steps.

First, from the main schemata click on **"Expand Content."** Note that you need an OpenAI key to configure this feature. To find out how to get one, you can visit [this link](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).

![image](images/step1-content-expander-homepage.png)


#### Step 1: Choose a URL

Begin by selecting the URL of the page you're working on. This could be a blog post, article, or any web page that you're looking to enhance. The Content Expander will analyze this page to understand its context and existing content.

![image](images/step3-content-expander-URL.png)


#### Step 2: Write Entities

Next, compile a **list of entities that you want to incorporate into your content**. These entities can be essential keywords, concepts, or topics related to your content. This step ensures that the generated content seamlessly integrates with your existing material.

![image](images/step4-content-expander-entities.png)


#### Step 3: Expand the Content

With the URL and entities in place, **it's time to let the Content Expander do its job**. With a single click, the Add-on will dynamically generate text that weaves these entities into your content, ready to enhance your page's relevance and search engine visibility.

![image](images/step5-content-expander-results.png)

You can **expand the window to read the text better**. You can decide to add entities or remove them from the list. By clicking on “Expand Content”, **you can regenerate the text**. 

![image](images/step-6-content-expander-results-expanded.png)


#### Step 4: Copy and Paste Into Your Page

Once the content is generated, simply **copy and paste the content generated directly into your website**. It's that easy! You'll immediately notice how the expanded content elevates the depth and relevance of your page.

And there you have it! With just three straightforward steps, you can significantly **improve your content's performance on search engines**.


### 6. Get Traffic Data 

To know which search queries you should boost, you can connect the SEO add-on to your Google Search Console and sort the analysis based on your traffic data. Here you will also find a column with the **Opportunity Score**, which suggests which search queries you should target to choose the best ones for your content.

You can now **select the relevant entities**. If you have WordPress with WordLift plugin we can import the entities straight into your knowledge graph, otherwise you can copy the JSON-LD from the sidebar into your own CMS or web page.

<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhxiRj7_ZKs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>


:::info Note
The **SEO add-on for Google Sheets™ is included in the [Business plan](https://wordlift.io/pricing/)**, and only by purchasing this plan you can use the content expander. Alternatively, you can buy the [SEO Add-On for Google Sheets](https://deals.thenextweb.com/sales/lifetime-subscription-wordlift-standard?aid=&utm_campaign=feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_source=thenextweb) from TNW website (in this case, the content expander is not included). 
:::

## Why is it asking for the country to be added?

This is because Google SERP is different from country to another and the top ranking results can be different. It’s important to understand that local versions of Google results look different depending on where you are searching from.

## How can the location affect the analysis?

Google's SERP changes depending on the location. Therefore, it is important to enter it before starting the search: only then will the results of the analysis be reliable for the market and audience your company is interested in.

## Installation

:::info Note
We **suggest** our users to make a full back-up of their website data before installing WordLift.
:::

### Requirements

WordLift is currently available on [WordPress] 5.3 and later.

### Installation

You can install **WordLift** from the [WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordlift/) or manually by uploading the files to your server.

#### Automatic Installation

Automatic installation is the easiest way to install WordLift. WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WordLift, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WordLift” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the description, the features, and user reviews. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

#### Manual Installation

The manual installation method involves *downloading our plugin* and *uploading it to your webserver* using your favourite FTP application.

Download the provided zip file to the `wp-content/plugins` directory of your [WordPress] installation. Unzip the file,

from the command line:

```
unzip wordlift.zip
```

More information on the manual installation are available on the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) website.

### Activation

To activate the plugin you need a [WordLift key](/pages/key-concepts#wordlift-key). You receive this key after [purchasing a subscription plan](https://wordlift.io/pricing/) the [WordLift] website. An automatic email will be then sent to you containing your key and account information.

You can use the setup Wizard upon startup to activate your subscription.

![image](./images/wordlift-setup-wizard.gif)

When doing so you are able to configure the [key](/pages/key-concepts#wordlift-key), the entity base path (the URL pattern of the WordLift internal vocabulary), the languange used on the website and the publisher of the website.

Alternatively, from the WordPress administration menu, click on *Plugins* / *Installed Plugins*. Then click on *Settings* on the
WordLift plugin.

### Configuration

The *Settings* are also accessible by hovering on the WordLift logo on the WordPress dashboard menu; from there a menu will open.

:::info Note
The *Settings* are different based on the type of license. [Find out more about our plans](https://wordlift.io/pricing).
:::

Click on *Settings* to open the settings screen:

![image](./images/wordlift-settings-screen.png)

From *Settings* screen, as from the Wizard, you can configure:

**WordLift Key**

The [WordLift Key](/pages/key-concepts#wordlift-key), required to activate the plug-in that can be purchased from the [website](https://wordlift.io/pricing/).

**Entity Base Path**

When selecting or creating new entities with WordLift, you are actively building your internal vocabulary, adding pages to  your website. When you first built your website, you chose a pattern for the url of the pages you were going to add, such as www.domain.com/name-of-the-page or www.domain.com/seo-keyword/name-of-the-page.
  The same applies with all the pages created with WordLift inside your vocabulary.
  By default WordLift will add the word “vocabulary” between your root domain and the name of the page: www.domain.com/vocabulary/name-of-the-entity-page.
  You can delete the word vocabulary if you want the new entity page to be inside your root domain folder: www.domain.com/name-of-the-entity-page.
  Or you can replace vocabulary with another keyword (or keywords) of your choice, for SEO or branding reason: www.domain.com/seo-keyword/name-of-the-entity-page.

**Country**

This is the country that you are targeting for SEO. WordLift uses the language configured on the WordPress settings as the primary language.

**Website Alternate Name**

Google Search uses several sources from a site's homepage to determine site names automatically. WordLift will use the website's name (configured via WordPress) as the default name. Suppose you want to provide an alternate version of your site name (for example, an acronym or shorter name). In that case, you can do this by configuring the alternate name property here. WordLift will use otherwise, by default, the tagline of your website. Read more about [WebSite Structured Data](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/structured-data-homepage/).

**Publisher**

The person or the organization publishing the content of the website. This is also an entity that can be created directly from this setting screen. This information is used to enrich the metadata on your website.

**Link by Default**

You can choose if you want WordLift to add links to the entities you create by default automatically. Read more about [Link by Default](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/link-no-link-question/).

**Send Diagnostic Data**

You can choose if you want to send diagnostic data to WordLift. This data is used to improve the plugin and to provide support.

### Tutorial

Learn the how to get started with WordLift with these simple video demo's.

#### What is WordLift?

[WordLift](https://wordlift.io/) helps your website speak Google's native language by converting your content into a format easily understood by search engines: **structured data**.

Leveraging Natural Language Processing and AI, **WordLift analyzes your content and identifies the most relevant topics for your business**, organizing them into **entities**. Each entity describes an idea, concept, person, or place you're talking about on your website. Entities are saved in a **vocabulary**. But WordLift goes deeper than that. It relates the entities in your vocabulary and turns the information into linked data, creating a [Knowledge Graph](https://wordlift.io/entity/knowledge-graph/).

Imagine the Knowledge Graph as **the infrastructure behind your content** that effectively helps **Google and search engines understand and index your content**. As a result, **users** searching for products, services, or businesses like yours **will find more relevant information** that meets their needs.

The result is the strengthening of the **authority and reliability of your website**, the growth of **internal link building**, which helps Google and search engines understand the relationships between pages and content and their value, and **increases organic traffic and the time users spend on your website**.

#### How does WordLift work?

With WordLift, you can **add structured data to your website**. This way, Google and the search engines know what you're talking about.

Once you have installed WordLift and started the plug-in, the AI will analyze the text for each piece of content on your website and **suggest which concepts are relevant for your business**. You can **add schema markup** to these concepts, and **they will represent entities in your Knowledge Graph.**

The entities will be part of [your vocabulary](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/use-vocabulary). They can be linked within your articles, enriching your content and creating a dynamic environment where users can move around and find information relevant to their search intent.

Using WordLift is simple. To take the first steps with us, **watch the video here**.

<iframe src="//content.jwplatform.com/players/PrVjEF9V-Aq9gyX5k.html" width="100%" height="540" frameborder="0" scrolling="auto"></iframe>

#### How can you create an entity with WordLift?

**Entities** in WordLift are web pages that describe the "things" you talk about on your website. **All entities are organized into a vocabulary within WordPress**. Each entity is a web page and corresponds to a data point that WordLift creates in the data network.

Creating an entity with WordLift is simple. To learn how to do it and start building your vocabulary, **watch the video here**.

<iframe src="//content.jwplatform.com/players/Eq57aiqy-Aq9gyX5k.html" width="100%" height="540" frameborder="0" scrolling="auto"></iframe>

**Entities help organize the content that you're writing. \*\*As you annotate an article with an entity, \*\*WordLift creates a relationship** between the article and entity so that a **computer can better understand it** and **you can build your Knowledge Graph**.

## Overview

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AR2pBOTLsy4" width="100%" height="540" frameborder="0" scrolling="auto"></iframe>

**WordLift** brings the power of *Artificial Intelligence* to web publishers around the World.

**WordLift** is a plugin for WordPress designed to help you create, structure and visualize your content and to publish it as [Linked Open Data](/pages/key-concepts#linked-open-data) following **Tim Berners-Lee**'s [Linked Data Principles](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html).

Linked Data is the language machines can read and understand in order to seamlessly analyze content, index it and fetch answers back to users.
Linked Data technologies allow software agents and search crawlers find, share and integrate information across different resources.

**WordLift** supports bloggers and site owners building *beautifully structured web sites* and reach their maximum potential audiences:

- It understands the text you write and structures it to allow you to create effective navigation flows and make sure commercial search engines like Google, Bing, Yandex and Yahoo! receive the structured data they need to properly index and rank your content.
- It  enriches your blog posts and pages with facts, links and images, and organizes them in relationship to each other, to internal vocabularies, and to other openly available data sources like DBpedia and Wikidata, increasing your readers’ engagement.

:::info Note
**WordLift** is available to all for a monthly fee. Find out more and get your activation key directly [on our website](https://wordlift.io).

# Advanced Topics

## Knowledge Graph

A **knowledge graph** is a network of all kind of entities that are relevant to a specific domain or to an organization.
They are not limited to abstract concepts and relations (as with a vocabulary) but also contain the instances of the things they describe.

Using WordLift as new entities are added in the vocabulary, properties for these entities are populated using the
*ease-to-use* WordPress editing interfaces and new posts are enriched with these entities a knowledge graph is
created and published as [RDF](#rdf) graph in the cloud.

### Linked Data

**Linked Open Data** is [Linked Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) that is made available as **open content**.
Large linked open datasets (or [Knowledge Graph](#knowledge-graph)) include DBpedia and Freebase.

### Reconciliation

**Reconciling** entities we store in our own [vocabulary](#system-message-1) with entities available elsewhere provides computers with an unambiguous way to identify the things we're talking about.

*\[Apple\]* in a specific article might refer to a rather typical British psychedelic-pop band rather than to a World famous computer company or the forbidden fruit. This becomes important when third party applications like search engines need to provide valuable content for users searching for articles on *\[Apple\]* the psychedelic-pop band and not the other two *Apples*.

[Reconciling](/pages/key-concepts#reconciliation) entities means providing computers with unambiguous identifications of the *entities* we talk about.

## RDF

**RDF** stands for Resource Description Framework.

RDF is a W3C standard language for representing information.

## Semantic Fingerprint

The result of semantic annotation of a text is a *unique linked identifier* added to the HTML code. This identifier is known as **semantic fingerprint**.

Annotating contents, also known as *semantic enrichment* or *lifting*, creates metadata that computers can understand.
Just like in forensic science human fingerprints are used to identify humans appearing on a crime scene, in computer science we use semantic fingerprints to tell computers what [entities](/pages/key-concepts#entity) we're referring to.

WordLift re-uses these semantic fingerprints for adding Schema.org markup and for re-purposing contents using [Widgets](/pages/key-concepts#widget).

## Dereferencing HTTP URIs

**URI Dereferencing** is the process of looking up a URI on the Web in order to get information about the referenced resource. WordLift uses dereferencing to obtain a snapshot of the properties describing a [named entity](/pages/key-concepts#entity).

## Semantic Analytics with WordLift Looker Studio Connector

![Semantic Analytics Connector 1](./images/semantics-analytics-connector-1.png)

## Automatic Pagination and Table of Contents

**Pagination** allows website editors to split long content into different pages. This technique really belongs to the ABC of web design and information architecture, but — still — **pagination SEO best practices are debated**. Therefore, dealing with it is not that easy as it could seem.

Want to learn more about it? Head over to our blog post that covers the application of an [SEO friendly pagination](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/pagination-seo-wordpress-plugin/) .

## Image SEO

Images greatly contribute to a website’s SEO and improve the overall user experience. Fully optimizing images is about helping users, and search engines, better understand the content of an article.
