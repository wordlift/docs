At the moment, only one language per import is supported. Therefore, if your feed contains multiple languages, use the **Path** to filter the language (e.g., **/en**). Then you can create another configuration for another language.

> **Behind the Scenes:**
> The tool validates and maps the feed data to create a consistent structure for your Product Knowledge Graph. Language filters help ensure that the correct version of your content is imported.

### 3. Create your Product Knowledge Graph

**What You Do:**
Link your website and import the data from the Merchant Feed to the website. To **create your Product Knowledge Graph** you need to add the provided script into your website.

Click **Finish**. Once you have completed these 3 steps, you will see that the **products** have been imported into the backend of your e-commerce website and **already enriched with structured data.**

From the WordLift dashboard, you can open the backend of your website to view the imported products and synchronize the data (this process takes about 1 hour).

> **Behind the Scenes:**
> When you add the script to your website, it initiates a secure connection between your site and our servers. Data is then synchronized using batch updates and caching techniques to ensure efficient processing.

### Last Update

The update of [Product Knowledge Graph Builder](https://wordlift.io/seo-for-non-wordpress-ecommerce/) added important elements to this feature:

- You can **reassign an existing merchant feed configuration to another Google account** that is not the same as the originally configured account. This way you have control over your data even if the platform was configured by someone else.
- In the PKG Builder configuration, you can **add a custom domain** and specify the dataset you want to use.
- You can check the **inport synchronization** at any time.
- **Change the "Seller Name."** This element, which cannot be edited in the Merchant Feed, is customizable in our Builder.

> **Behind the Scenes:**
> These new features allow for greater flexibility and control. The modular design of our system ensures that updates and customizations are applied seamlessly without disrupting the overall data flow.
