## Prerequisites

1. **Agent WordLift Access**: Ensure you have access to Agent WordLift's enhanced tools
2. **Research Objectives**: Define what type of entity intelligence you need
3. **Content Goals**: Identify how enhanced data will improve your content or strategy

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Basic Entity Research

Start with a comprehensive entity lookup:

```
Research comprehensive information about [entity name] using the enhanced Google Knowledge Graph with WordLift semantic enrichment. Include all available biographical, corporate, or geographic data.
```

**Example for Person Research:**
```
Research comprehensive information about "Albert Einstein" using the enhanced Google Knowledge Graph with WordLift semantic enrichment. Include all available biographical data.
```

### Step 2: Corporate Intelligence Gathering

For business and competitive research:

```
Analyze the company [company name] using enhanced knowledge graph data. Include headquarters, key people, industry classification, founding details, and semantic relationships with competitors.
```

**Example:**
```
Analyze the company "Rocket Mortgage" using enhanced knowledge graph data. Include headquarters, key people, industry classification, founding details, and semantic relationships with competitors.
```

### Step 3: Entity Relationship Mapping

Discover connections between entities:

```
Map the semantic relationships between [entity1] and [entity2] using enhanced knowledge graph data. Identify shared attributes, connections, and contextual relationships.
```

**Example:**
```
Map the semantic relationships between "Tesla Inc" and "SpaceX" using enhanced knowledge graph data. Identify shared attributes, connections, and contextual relationships.
```

### Step 4: Multi-Entity Comparative Analysis

Research multiple related entities:

```
Compare and analyze the following entities using enhanced knowledge graph data: [entity1], [entity2], [entity3]. Highlight similarities, differences, and competitive positioning.
```

**Example:**
```
Compare and analyze the following entities using enhanced knowledge graph data: Apple Inc, Microsoft Corporation, Google LLC. Highlight similarities, differences, and competitive positioning.
```

### Step 5: Content Enhancement Research

Gather entity data specifically for content creation:
