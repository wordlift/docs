## Introduction

Today, our goal is to **create, with the help of WordLift, compelling posts for LinkedIn** using the content we have on our website. In this example, we will use the agent’s multifunctional capability to **perform several tasks based on a single prompt**. WordLift AI SEO Agent will analyze content, extract entities, suggest keywords, and generate SEO-optimized posts for a specific audience on LinkedIn.

## Writing Posts for LinkedIn

We will start with a first example related to our website to write content around “neuro-symbolic AI.”

### Here goes the prompt

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Search for 'neuro-symbolic AI' and carefully analyze the writing style on my website, then extract entities and suggest keywords, and, with this in mind, write three SEO-optimized LinkedIn posts to promote the topic to a business audience in the publishing sector. Always add links back to the website to help users discover additional information.
```

### Here goes the prompt for X

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Search for 'neuro-symbolic AI' and carefully analyze the writing style on my website and, with this in mind, create a Twitter thread to promote the topic to web publishers. Always add links back to the website to help users discover additional information.
