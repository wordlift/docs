## Quick Topic Research

The simplest way to start is by providing just your topic of interest:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Find relevant discussions on Reddit about skincare routines and create a content proposal
```

## Advanced Research Options

### Analyze Specific Websites

When you have specific websites to analyze:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Analyze these websites for "skincare routines":
https://example1.com/skincare
https://example2.com/beauty
https://example3.com/routines

Then find relevant discussions on Reddit and create a content proposal.
```

### Discover Top Rankings

To analyze top-ranking domains and Reddit discussions:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Find the top 5 ranking domains for "skincare routines", analyze their content, and compare with Reddit discussions to create a content proposal.
```

## How It Works

## Next Steps

Enhance your research with follow-up analysis:

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Create an outline showing how the discussed topics could be structured into a content series
```
