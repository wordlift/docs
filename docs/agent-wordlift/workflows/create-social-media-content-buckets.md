## Introduction

**Content buckets** are categories of information that we can use to organize our content. Each bucket is different, but they should all relate back to the overall brand message.

Content buckets are not topics. They are types of content. The buckets you use can vary depending on our business goals.

We will start with a first example to build content buckets for social media around the topics “GS1” and "GS1 Digital Link" using the content from our company's blog.

### Here goes the prompt

```md className=wlx-send-to-agent
Search for content related to 'GS1', 'GS1 Digital Link' and create content buckets from Social Media.
```
