# Google Instagram Indexing Report

As of **July 10, 2025**, Instagram content has switched from "part-indexed" to "fully indexable" in Google Search, making every reel, carousel, and highlight a potential search asset. This workflow demonstrates how to use Agent WordLift as a specialized sub-agent within Claude to analyze Instagram content alignment with your website and organic search rankings.

## Setup Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Claude account with MCP integration enabled
- Agent WordLift MCP server configured (see [MCP Integration Guide](../integrations.md#agent-wordlift-model-context-protocol-mcp-integration))
- Instagram business account
- Google Search Console access

### MCP Configuration
Ensure Agent WordLift is configured as your MCP server in Claude:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wordlift": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.wordlift.io/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Initialize the Analysis

Start by prompting Claude with Agent WordLift as the sub-agent:

```md
I need to generate a comprehensive Instagram indexing report for [your_instagram_handle]. Please use Agent WordLift to:

1. Analyze my website's current search performance
2. Audit Instagram content indexing status
3. Identify content alignment opportunities
4. Provide optimization recommendations

Let's start by connecting to my Google Search Console data and analyzing my website's entity structure.
```

### Step 2: Search Operators Audit

Use these specific search operators to audit Instagram exposure:

#### 1. Total Profile Footprint
```
site:instagram.com/{yourhandle}
```
**Purpose:** See how many of your posts (reels, tags, stories, etc.) are indexed by Google.

#### 2. Topic-Specific Posts
```
site:instagram.com/{yourhandle} "{keyword}"
```
**Purpose:** Track exposure for key topics relevant to your business.

#### 3. Content Clusters (Synonyms/Multilingual)
```
site:instagram.com/{yourhandle} ("{keyword1}" OR "{keyword2}" OR "{keyword3}")
```
**Purpose:** Capture variations and multilingual content.

#### 4. Recent Content Pulse
```
site:instagram.com/{yourhandle} ("2024" OR "2025" OR "recent")
```
**Purpose:** Measure how much recent or time-sensitive content is being indexed.

#### 5. Brand-Topic Crossover
```
site:instagram.com "{yourhandle}" "{niche_keyword}"
```
**Purpose:** Check if your brand appears in conversations beyond your profile.

### Step 3: Content Correlation Analysis

Prompt Claude to use Agent WordLift for deep analysis:

```md
Using Agent WordLift, please:

1. Extract the main entities and topics from my website's top 10 pages
2. Analyze my Instagram content using the search operators above
3. Identify content gaps between website and Instagram
4. Suggest content themes that could benefit from cross-platform optimization
5. Provide specific recommendations for improving content alignment
```

### Step 4: Competitive Intelligence

```md
Analyze how competitors are leveraging Instagram indexing:

1. Run the same search operators for 3-5 competitor Instagram accounts
2. Compare their indexed content volume vs. mine
3. Identify topics where competitors have better Instagram visibility
4. Suggest content opportunities based on gaps found
```

### Step 5: Performance Monitoring Setup

```md
Help me establish a monitoring system:

1. Create a list of key search queries where Instagram content could rank
2. Set up tracking for these queries using Google Search Console integration
3. Establish baseline metrics for current Instagram visibility
4. Create a reporting schedule for ongoing monitoring
```
