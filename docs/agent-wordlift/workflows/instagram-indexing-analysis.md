# Instagram Indexing Analysis (AI Sub-Agent Workflow)

:::info MCP-Powered Workflow
This workflow leverages Agent WordLift as a specialized SEO sub-agent through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration](../integrations.md#agent-wordlift-model-context-protocol-mcp-integration). Agent WordLift provides deep SEO expertise while working seamlessly within Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini.
:::

With Instagram switching from "part-indexed" to "fully indexable" in Google Search on July 10, 2025, every reel, carousel, and highlight can become a valuable search asset. This workflow helps you analyze how well your Instagram content aligns with your website content and organic search rankings.

## Why This Matters

With **AI Overviews reducing organic CTR by 34–37%**, social media indexing becomes critical for visibility. Instagram accounts are already ranking above medical directories for competitive terms even before the July 10th switch.

## What This Workflow Analyzes

- **Live SERP Queries** – Real-time visibility checks using verified rankings
- **Search Console Integration** – Pull in actual performance data from your website
- **Trend Analysis** – Use Google Trends (Jan–June 2025) for topical validation
- **Content Correlation** – Measure alignment between website and Instagram posts
- **Competitive Intelligence** – Benchmark visibility across platforms

## Prerequisites

1. **Set up MCP Integration**: Follow our [MCP setup guide](../integrations.md#agent-wordlift-model-context-protocol-mcp-integration) to connect Agent WordLift with your preferred AI assistant
2. **Google Search Console Access**: Ensure your website is connected to Google Search Console
3. **Instagram Business Account**: Access to the Instagram account you want to analyze

## Search Operators for Instagram Auditing

Use these search operators to audit your Instagram exposure:

### 1. Total Profile Footprint
```
site:instagram.com/{yourhandle}
```
**Purpose**: See how many of your posts (reels, tags, stories, etc.) are indexed by Google.

### 2. Posts About a Specific Topic
```
site:instagram.com/{yourhandle} "{keyword}"
```
**Purpose**: Track exposure for key topics like "chirurgia ortognatica" or any niche term.

### 3. Content Clusters (Synonyms/Multilingual)
```
site:instagram.com/{yourhandle} ("{keyword1}" OR "{keyword2}" OR "{keyword3}")
```
**Purpose**: Useful for capturing variations: e.g. "impianto" OR "implant" OR "protesi".

### 4. Recent Content Pulse
```
site:instagram.com/{yourhandle} ("2024" OR "2025" OR "mesi" OR "giorni")
```
**Purpose**: Measure how much recent or time-sensitive content is being indexed.

### 5. Brand-Topic Crossover
```
site:instagram.com "{yourhandle}" "{niche_keyword}"
```
**Purpose**: Check if your brand is showing up in conversations tied to your niche—even beyond your profile.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Setup in Your AI Assistant

Start by asking your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to activate Agent WordLift:

```
I need to analyze my Instagram content's search visibility using Agent WordLift. Please help me set up an Instagram indexing analysis for my account @{yourhandle} in the {your_niche} industry.
```

### Step 2: Website Content Analysis

Ask Agent WordLift to analyze your website's current content:

```
Using Agent WordLift, analyze my website's content for the following topics: [list your main topics]. I want to understand what content themes are already covered on my site.
```

### Step 3: Instagram Content Indexing Check

Run the search operators to check current Instagram indexing:

```
Please use the search operators to check my Instagram indexing status:
1. site:instagram.com/{yourhandle}
2. site:instagram.com/{yourhandle} "{your_main_keyword}"
3. Check for recent content indexing with date-related terms
```

### Step 4: Content Alignment Analysis

Compare your Instagram content with your website content:

```
Compare the topics and keywords from my Instagram posts with my website content. Identify:
- Content gaps where Instagram covers topics not on my website
- Opportunities to create website content based on successful Instagram posts
- Keyword overlaps and potential cannibalization issues
```

### Step 5: SERP Position Analysis

Check where your Instagram content ranks for your target keywords:

```
For my main keywords [list keywords], check:
- Where my Instagram posts rank in search results
- Where my website pages rank for the same keywords
- Which content type (Instagram vs website) performs better for each keyword
```

### Step 6: Competitive Intelligence

Analyze competitors' Instagram indexing:

```
Analyze my top 3 competitors' Instagram indexing:
- @{competitor1}
- @{competitor2}
- @{competitor3}

Compare their indexed content volume and topics with mine.
```

### Step 7: Content Strategy Recommendations

Get actionable recommendations:

```
Based on the analysis, provide recommendations for:
- Which Instagram posts should be expanded into website content
- Which website topics should be covered more on Instagram
- Optimization strategies for better search visibility
- Content calendar suggestions for July-December 2025
```

## Example Prompts for AI Assistants

### For Claude with MCP
```
Using Agent WordLift through MCP, analyze my Instagram account @orthognatica_roma for search visibility. Compare the indexed Instagram content with my website content and provide recommendations for improving overall search presence in the orthodontic surgery niche.
```

### For ChatGPT with Agent WordLift
```
I need Agent WordLift to help me understand how my Instagram content @{yourhandle} is performing in Google search results. Analyze the content alignment with my website and suggest optimization strategies for the upcoming Instagram indexing changes.
```

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this workflow, you'll have:

- **Complete inventory** of your indexed Instagram content
- **Content gap analysis** between Instagram and website
- **SERP position insights** for both platforms
- **Competitive benchmarking** data
- **Strategic recommendations** for content optimization
