:::info MCP-Powered Workflow
This workflow leverages Agent WordLift as a specialized SEO sub-agent through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration](../integrations.md#agent-wordlift-model-context-protocol-mcp-integration). Agent WordLift provides deep SEO expertise while working seamlessly within Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini.

With Instagram switching from "part-indexed" to "fully indexable" in Google Search on July 10, 2025, every reel, carousel, and highlight can become a valuable search asset. This workflow helps you analyze how well your Instagram content aligns with your website content and organic search rankings.

## How Agent WordLift Works in This Analysis

Agent WordLift automatically uses multiple sophisticated tools to provide comprehensive Instagram indexing analysis that goes far beyond basic social media analytics:

- **Google Search Console Integration** ‚Äì Pulls real performance data from your website with 2025 search trends
- **Live SERP Analysis** ‚Äì Conducts real-time visibility checks showing exact rankings (e.g., "#3 for brand terms")
- **Google Trends Analysis** ‚Äì Identifies search spikes and correlates them with content performance (e.g., "100/100 trend spike in May 2025")
- **Entity Gap Analysis** ‚Äì Compares content themes between Instagram and website with precision scoring
- **Advanced Search Operators** ‚Äì Automatically runs complex queries to audit Instagram exposure across multiple dimensions
- **Competitive Intelligence** ‚Äì Benchmarks your visibility against medical authorities and industry competitors
- **Emerging Keyword Discovery** ‚Äì Identifies new trending terms like "chad aesthetic" and "chirurgia estetica mandibola"
- **Cross-Platform Correlation** ‚Äì Shows how content performance connects across Instagram, website, and search behavior

### What Makes This Analysis Unique

Unlike traditional social media analytics, this workflow provides **verified search performance data** showing exactly how Instagram content performs in Google's organic search results, with insights like:

- Instagram ranking #3 for "ortognatica roma" (above Facebook and YouTube)
- Instagram ranking #5 for competitive medical terms like "chirurgia ortognatica roma"
- Correlation between May 2025 search spikes and Instagram content effectiveness
- 92% content alignment scores between website strategy and indexed social content

## Why This Matters

With **AI Overviews reducing organic CTR by 34‚Äì37%**, social media indexing becomes critical for visibility. Instagram accounts are already ranking above medical directories for competitive terms even before the July 10th switch.

## Prerequisites

1. **Set up MCP Integration**: Follow our [MCP setup guide](../integrations.md#agent-wordlift-model-context-protocol-mcp-integration) to connect Agent WordLift with your preferred AI assistant
2. **Google Search Console Access**: Ensure your website is connected to Google Search Console
3. **Instagram Account**: Access to the Instagram account you want to analyze

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Setup in Your AI Assistant

Start by asking your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to activate Agent WordLift:

```
I need to analyze my Instagram content's search visibility using Agent WordLift. Please help me set up an Instagram indexing analysis for my account @{yourhandle} in the {your_niche} industry.
```

### Step 2: Website Content Analysis

Ask Agent WordLift to analyze your website's current content:

```
Using Agent WordLift, analyze my website's content for the following topics: [list your main topics]. I want to understand what content themes are already covered on my site.
```

### Step 3: Content Alignment Analysis

Compare your Instagram content with your website content:

```
Compare the topics and keywords from my Instagram posts with my website content. Identify:
- Content gaps where Instagram covers topics not on my website
- Opportunities to create website content based on successful Instagram posts
- Keyword overlaps and potential cannibalization issues
```

### Step 4: SERP Position Analysis

Check where your Instagram content ranks for your target keywords:

```
For my main keywords [list keywords], check:
- Where my Instagram posts rank in search results
- Where my website pages rank for the same keywords
- Which content type (Instagram vs website) performs better for each keyword
```

### Step 5: Competitive Intelligence

Analyze competitors' Instagram indexing:

```
Analyze my top 3 competitors' Instagram indexing:
- @{competitor1}
- @{competitor2}
- @{competitor3}

Compare their indexed content volume and topics with mine.
```

### Step 6: Content Strategy Recommendations

Get actionable recommendations:

```
Based on the analysis, provide recommendations for:
- Which Instagram posts should be expanded into website content
- Which website topics should be covered more on Instagram
- Optimization strategies for better search visibility
- Content calendar suggestions for July-December 2025
```

## Example Prompts for AI Assistants

### For Claude with MCP
```
Using Agent WordLift through MCP, analyze my Instagram account @orthognatica_roma for search visibility. Compare the indexed Instagram content with my website content and provide recommendations for improving overall search presence in the orthodontic surgery niche.
```

### For ChatGPT with Agent WordLift
```
I need Agent WordLift to help me understand how my Instagram content @{yourhandle} is performing in Google search results. Analyze the content alignment with my website and suggest optimization strategies for the upcoming Instagram indexing changes.
```
