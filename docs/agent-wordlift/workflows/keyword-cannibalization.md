# Avoiding Keyword Cannibalization with WordLift AI SEO Agent

In this workflow, we'll explore how to identify and resolve **keyword cannibalization** issues using the WordLift AI SEO Agent. Keyword cannibalization occurs when multiple pages on your website target the same keyword, causing them to compete against each other in search engine rankings. This can dilute your SEO efforts and confuse search engines about which page to rank for the keyword.

## Identifying Keyword Overlap Between Pages

Let's utilize the content analysis tools to extract entities, keywords, and understand the detailed search intent behind each page. This will help us identify overlapping areas and develop strategies to differentiate the content.

### Example Prompt for Analyzing and Differentiating Pages

```md

- **URL1:** Article: https://wordlift.io/blog/en/underutilized-schema-markups-for-publishers/
  - **Title1:** Underutilized Schema Markups for Publishers

For each page, perform the following analyses:

- **Extract Entities:**
