# WordLift Vector Store for LlamaIndex ü¶ô

[WordLift Vector Store](https://llamahub.ai/l/vector_stores/llama-index-vector-stores-wordlift?from=) is a **Knowledge Graph-based Vector SLlamaIndex**. This integration enables WordLift to be used as a vector store for LlamaIndex, allowing you to **work with your knowledge graph directly from your codebase**.

With WordLift Vector Store, you can:

- Perform **Knowledge Graph retrieval-augmented generation (Knowledge-enabled RAG)** using your knowledge graph data directly in your codebase.
- Add new nodes and search within your knowledge graph effortlessly.

## Getting Started

To start using the WordLift Vector Store, you need to configure your LlamaIndex project. Please read the [documentation on the LlamaIndex website](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/installation/).

‚ö†Ô∏è To use the WordLift Vector Store, you will need your WordLift Key. You can obtain a WordLift Key by subscribing to one of WordLift's plans. Start using this and other integrations by choosing the [**WordLift Business Plan**](https://s.wordlift.io/get-started/?product_id=51698&lang=en&_ga=2.229910552.580544220.1719219882-1472873283.1715336664). Once subscribed, you will receive your WordLift Key, which you can use to access the Vector Store and other features.

## Usage

See the example below to set up your first project.

```
# import the necessary modules
from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader, StorageContext
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.vector_stores.wordlift import WordliftVectorStore


# set the openAI key to use GPT as LLM (the default LlamaIndex LLM)
import os
import openai

openai.api_key = os.environ["your_openAI_key"]

# download a sample file and create documents from it
!mkdir 'data\paul_graham\'
!curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt' -O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'

documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham").load_data()


# Wordlift Knowledge Graphs are built on the principles of fully Linked Data,
# where each entity is assigned a permanent dereferentiable URI.

# When adding nodes to an existing Knowledge Graph, it's essential to include
# an "entity_id" in the metadata of each loaded document.

# For further insights into Fully Linked Data, explore these resources:
# [W3C Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html),
# [5 Star Data](https://5stardata.info/en/).

!curl https://api.wordlift.io/accounts/me -H 'Authorization: Key your_key' | jq .

# To generate the entity_id, concatenate the datasetURI with the normalized
# filename.

# For instance, if your datasetURI is `https://data.wordlift.io/wl0000000/` and # your text file is named `sample-file.txt`, the entity_id can be constructed
# as follows:
# `entity_id = datasetURI + normalize(filename)`
# which results in `https://data.wordlift.io/wl0000000/sample-file-txt`.

dataset_uri = "your_dataset_uri"

for document in documents:
 norm_filename = document.metadata["file_name"].replace(".", "-")
 entity_id = dataset_uri + norm_filename
 document.metadata["entity_id"] = entity_id

# Create an instance of Wordlift Vector Store
vector_store = WordliftVectorStore.create("your_key")

# set Wordlift vector store instance as the vector store
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)

index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents, storage_context=storage_context)

# test the vector store query
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("What did the author do growing up?")
print(response)

```
